<p>i arrived at haneda airport and waited in the line for immigration. i had already filled out the immigration and customs cards on the plane except the address of accomodation i am staying at because i needed internet to know that. so i connected to airport wifi look address up and write that on the cards when stood in the line.</p>
<p>the line reach the collect ur biometric data machines so i gave them my biometric data. then went through the thing where u give the officer ur passport and immigration card and they put a sticker in ur passport. quick process. and finally the one where u give customs card and passport to person and they say ok and u leave. quick process.</p>
<p>now im in the haneda airport ready to transfer to domestic flight. but first i stop by the bic camera and buy data sim card. ok!</p>

<p>then i go to go into the security checkpoint to go to domestic flight. but the thing where u scan ur boarding pass and it lets u through turned red didnt let me through. oop!</p>
<p>someone standing by sayed something like, oh this checkpoint is for international flights. u need to go to terminal uh two? i think. there is free shuttle bus. ok thank you!, and so i went to find the bus, and i found it and rode it and reached appropriate terminal where i went through security.</p>
<p>then i walked around the gates for about an hour take photo, video of planes, and also some kind of autonomous moving platform seat things that was driving around.</p>

</figure>
<p>arrive at kmi, i walk to the train station. looking at the schedule i remember that there is a limousine bus that will actually come sooner than train (i looked this up before trip).</p>
<p>so i go look for it slightly anxiety that im gonna miss it or i will idk how to pay it. however walk back along where i came from, there seem to be bus platforms. and there was a bus that seemed to be correct one, probably labeled something like “airport limousine”, “towards miyazaki station”, etc., so i got on it.</p>
<p>there was a spot look like you can tap ur IC transport card so i tap it board the bus, seem correct. the only spot free where i was not sitting directly next to someone else was the very back middlest seat. which was a cool spot to ride the bus at night.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF3773.webp" id="DSCF3773" alt="" /><figcaption>6.20 19:45 Here is a picture of where im sitting in the bus. to my right was a stereotypical bad manner posture person which took up like three seats lie on they side propped up on they arm and bare feet or sth</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>im riding the bus, my plan is to ride to the endpoint “miyazaki station”, take train to “south miyazaki station”, and from there take the last 21:31-departing train going to kagoshima.</p>
<p>However at some point the bus says its gonna stop at <ruby>南宮崎駅<rt>south miyazaki station</rt></ruby><ruby>前通<rt>in front street??</rt></ruby> which sound like i should stop there, so i reach over to press the button signal u wanna get off and pressed something that was like a USB charging port or something..</p>
<p>i was confused and it was dark but eventually realized the correct button was slightly more to the right so i reached over more and pressed it.</p>
<p>im getting off the bus beep my ic card to get off. and then the driver say sth to me. but idk what. i lean closer and tilt head in that way one does when u didnt hear what someone sayed. and then they was gesture to ic card beepreader next to them and based on the context and understand like half of what they sayed i believe they meant sth like: u beeped on the wrong beepreader bro. when u get off u beep on this beepreader not that one u just beeped on. oops lol!, so i beeped on the correct one and got off.</p>
<p>i didnt really know where tf i was and my phone has no data and no nothing so i just walked in the direction that seemed correct. luckily it was correct, shortly saw the South Miyazaki Station Building.</p>
<p>i walked over verify its the station. yeah it is. and then it is now about 8 pm, train is at 9:30 pm, so what do?.</p>
<p>how about some food? i dont yet ate dinner. eat would be nice. and in fact, there was a food place right at the station building. how convenient!</p>
<p>however, it was very “local” vibe. it was full of male students eating and socializing, which was intimidating. there was no sign of a formal server, reception person, etc. which was intimidating. The menu was posted in the window and only in japanese, which was also intimidating. it look like the type of shop you walk in and call out your order out to someone verbally and socialize with fellow local residents which was a very intimidating concept, especially for first night arrival.</p>
<p>so i kind of pace around front of station and that food place contemplating life. hmm what do i do? go in without knowing what exactly to do i will definitely appear strange and feel uncomfortable. how anxiety!</p>
<p>then, i wonder: what if i ask someone. to help me order. there was some people waiting in front of station. maybe i can ask them help me order. To ask someone help me is less uncomfortable than go in alone not knowing anything.</p>
<p>so i theorized who i should ask. there was some student using they phone. but then they got picked up in a car left. there was some guy but they looked busy on a phone. there was some woman but it feels kind of weird approach singular female party as singular male party. there was also an old guy pacing around but he kind of looked out of it and at some point walked away into the darkness (or got picked up?).</p>
<p>there was also some students coming and going from the restaurant. i think about stopping, asking one of them.</p>
<p>at some point, one of them come out of store. they looked approachable kind of, they physical appearance actually reminded me of my own. the vibe seemed OK as i approach. i gather my courages as i approach and get they attention and begin to speak.</p>
<p>this is approx what happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(me) approach. "sorry hi, i am Not Japanese. I want to eat Food over There. But, I do not know how to order. Could you uh.. help.. me</p>
<p>(guy) oh sure</p>
<p>(together) walk toward shop</p>
<p>(me) uh this uh (points at チキン南蛮定食 on the window menu) chikin nanba…. (i didnt 100% know how to read 南蛮)</p>
<p>(guy) reads チキン南蛮定食 to confirm and i agreed</p>
<p>(together) walk in.</p>
<p>(guy) addresses someone who appears to be store operator by they name and says something, i dont really remember what</p>
<p>(store operator? to me) you are one person?</p>
<p>(me) agree</p>
<p>(guy, to store operator) says the thing that i wanted. goes to leave</p>
<p>(store operator) sit over there</p>
<p>(me) go to sit over there</p>
<p>(some student passing by) good evening</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the store owner guy bring me over the standard glass of cold water and wipes the table and i sit there in the lively atmosphere of the local food establishment dissociating wonder how i end up here.</p>
<p>i take a hand wet wipe from the box on the table and open it and wipe my hands and randomly look at my phone as i listen to the human sounds to my left and back. occasionaly a students leave, greeting the entire food establishment good bye as they leave. there is also a student who seems to working for the restaurant who cleans the floor and the tables as the other students slowly leave.</p>

</figure>
<p>the food is given to me and i eat it. the chicken namban is a new food to me. the chicken has a slight burnt or charcoally flavor.</p>

</figure>
<p>as i ate the students became completely left, the customers that remain became only me and a party of two adults. from they conversations it seem like they was also once a local students as well, however i dont actually know japanese so i dont remember any exact phrases they said that made me think this.</p>
<p>i finished eating and got up to pay and leave. the remaining party of two sayed to me (in japanese) sth like, sorry for being so loud haha!, and i tried to say “No you are good haha” with nonverbal means like my facial expression and gestures and stuff.</p>
<p>im ready to pay walk over to store owner guy at his little counter at the front of store. i was unsure if i should put my used dishes somewhere so i stopped and looked around and at my dishes and looked a bit confused and maybe pointed at my dishes and looked at the owner who looked confused at why im confused and etc., so i assumed i didnt need to handle my own dishes so i walk up to pay. owner says (in japanese) thatll be 1100 yen. i hand over the money. i nonverbally say good bye and leave. the final words the owner says to me is, thank you very much! (in english).</p>
<p>i walk up the steps to the train station and beep in and go wait at the train platform. however as i beep in i just realise, uh oh i dont think theres a toilet past these gates. it is now only 8:50 something and train comes at 9:30 what if i need to use the bathroom. i shouldnt have beeped in oh no…</p>
<p>but for now i go to the platform i sit there wait, maybe take a picture or two. buy and drink vitamin c drink from vending machine. then think: darn i should go to bathroom now.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>so i walk back to gates and try to beep out. the beep turns red no u cant do that!! oop. so i go over to window which has station guy watching. i mumble something like uhhh.. <ruby>bathroom<rt>otearai</rt></ruby>.. The guy says: <ruby>where u come from<rt>doko kora kimashita</rt></ruby>. i say: <ruby>here<rt>koko</rt></ruby>. i hand him my ic card along with my phone it is attached to and he uses his computer system to do idk what with it and he says ok and i leave to go to bathroom. when i go to leave he sayed a final words sth like “<ruby>mata kimasu(?)<rt>you coming back(?)</rt></ruby>” which i wasnt completely sure what he meant by that but i agreed and went go to bathroom.</p>
<section id="did-the-train-itself-have-a-bathroom-as-well" class="aside">
<h2>did the train itself have a bathroom as well?</h2>
<p>i wonder if the train actually had a bathroom inside it. it seems like it might have had one. i dont remember if it did because i didnt try to look for it once i got on it.</p>
</section>
<p>i come back and try to beep in. red again cannot do that. i see guy in the office walking back to the window. i gesture going through the gates (btw there actually are no physical gates) and the guy seems to nonverbally agree so i go through and return to platform.</p>
<p>the train is already platform btw but dont open its doors or nothing yet. there is a small assembly of people waiting for the train as well.</p>
<p>eventually a train operating looking people come, causing people to line up get ready to board train. i do so as well. board the train, choose seat, wait for departure.</p>
<p>The train is a double front-facing seat arrangement and i was in a window seat with my bag in the aisle seat because everyone onboard seemed to fill second seat with they bag so i figured it was socially acceptable to do the same. but at some point, a salaryman-looking older man comes aboard looks to be looking for a seat. i felt kind of bad so i moved my bag on my lap. salaryman says something to me. i dont really know or remember what but i nonverbally agreed and he sat next to me. truth be told there was a little bug on that seat i was taking a picture of it earlier. i think he may have sat on it.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>however he cracks open a cold one (tall can of beer i think) and uses chopsticks eats from a little disposable plastic container cup of some food. smells like it got smoked salmon in it, I suppose that it is from a convenience store. the train departs.</p>
<p>it is a two and a half hour train ride. according to schedule, it departs south miyazaki station at 21:31, arrive at central kagoshima station at 24:03. i ride the train and get off at final stop, kagoshima central station.</p>

<img src="media/DSCF3807.webp" id="DSCF3807" alt="" /><figcaption>6.20 22:43 I took this picture of the train when it was pretty empty</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF3822.webp" id="DSCF3822" alt="" /><figcaption>6.20 23:41 This bug flew in at one stop and stayed there for a long time. i forgot when it got off, if it did.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>i go to beep out of the gates and it goes red nope cant do that!!! so, must go to station person at the window. ok. he informs me i could not used mine ic card for the trip i just took. he took my ic card and analyze it or sth in system and ask me if i got cash which i do and he told me its 2860 yen so i paid in cash and left.</p>
<section id="i-barely-had-enough-cash" class="aside">
<h2>i barely had enough cash</h2>
<p>after paying i had remaining money 390 yen in cash which was comprised of one 100 yen coin and nineteen 10 yen coins.</p>
</section>
<p>i walk to the hotel and check in. then i probably washed, and then theorize plans for the next day. i made up the following plan:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>6:00am wake up, reserve JR pass online</li>
<li>6:30am eat free hotel breakfast</li>
<li>7:00am pick up JR pass at kagoshima central station</li>
<li>Ride shinkansen “mizuho 602” from 7:32 (kagoshima central) to 8:51 (hakata)</li>
<li>Ride train “sonic 9” from 9:00 (hakata) to 9:43 (kokura)</li>
<li>Ride shinkansen “nozomi 18” from 9:52 (kokura) to 10:10 (shin yamaguchi)</li>
<li>Board train (SL yamaguchi) by 10:54</li>
</ol>
<p>That was the plan. However when i finished planning it was approx 1:45am. But according to my experience i will always wake up due to jetlag around 4 or 5 am. Even if very small amount of sleep. So i go to sleep.</p>
<section id="can-i-check-in-from-very-late" class="aside">
<h2>can i check in from very late?</h2>
<p>When planning the trip im a bit scared can i check into hotel after midnight? because i know my train arrive after midnight. I googled things and it said something like business hotels probably do very late night checkins but maybe you should let the hotel know. so when i was waiting for flight to japan in usa, i went to the hotel website and submitted an inquiry containing both english and japanese im going to arrive around 24:10 is it ok. and they replied with japanese message saying thx for letting us know ur checkin time. when i actually checked in it seemed like regular check in. someone appeared behind counter very promptly as if it was not a particularly irregular check-in time.</p>
