<p>I woke up naturally some time around 2am i think. The room was surprisingly quiet and calm, no snoring sounds. There was only like one person who was sort of heavily breathing. i took my camera and exited room and used bathroom and then walked around, took some pictures of mostly-empty ferry facilities. I also went out on the outside part of ferry. it was wet and sort of cold and windy. i took some uninspiring photos and went back inside. i also enjoyed a drink of hot water from the hot water tap using a paper packet cup thing. Back in bad, i was use my phone a bit because it seem we was close enough to japan to pick up mobile data signal. On my weak signal i booked a plane ticket to Okinawa. And then i went back to sleep.</p>

<h2>the decision to go to okinawa</h2>
<p>In my trip planning, i think: maybe i go to okinawa. but i dont know. Maybe i will go first half of trip. maybe i will go last half of trip. maybe i dont go. I am not sure. My plans was either go to okinawa or stay kyushu a bit/travel into west honshu. I decided: i will let the weather decide my schedule. And the weather determined that it was rainy in kyushu/west honshu and it was clear in okinawa. so i will go to okinawa now.</p>

<p>I wake up, the ferry is already docked in port i think, waiting to release the passengers. I gather my stuff and leave room. For a while i sit in the dining hall area where i charge my phone from an outlet i found.</p>

<p>Its time to go, so i go off the boat go through immigration and customs. It is basically like airport immigration&amp;customs. Except i remember this customs check the person asked to look in my bag, i think swabbed it or sth and tested it, and asked me questions about trip which was unusual because i never had either of those things happen at japan customs.</p>
<p>they let me go so i went, i take a bus to go to a donki hote. but before entering the donkihote, i first stop at the mcdonalds across the street for some break fast.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>i order some food on the kiosk, decide to eat in the store. I stand, wait for the food. It looks like person about to call my order or sth. However they dont actually call my order, they say “is person with order [number] here?” and i walk up because i believe i have that number. Then they explain something to me which honestly idk and gave me a number tent and i think told me to go sit somewhere. so i went to sit down somewhere.</p>
<p>Truth be told, i didnt actually know if i was the correct customer. i did not fully hear and comprehend the number. I also dont know why exactly they want me to sit down in advance. I assume its because something like frying something would take longer than expected. I assume this because once i had a similar experience at wendy’s, something was not ready so they gave me half my order and told me sit down they bring the rest later.</p>
<p>So i sat at a counter downstairs with my number tent displayed, sort of stressed that i was actually not the relevant customer. However after some time a worker showed up bring food which was the food i ordered so i guess i was the relevant customer.</p>
<p>I ate the food. The bread was noticeably fluffy, and the chicken nuggets were plump and freshly fried. wow..</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I eat and handle my tray waste and go to don quihote. I am searching for lightweight indoor shoes that i can wear inside a gym. I have a product i looked up online in don quihote, so i look for that product. i cant find it or anything similar. So i walk up to a counter with an employee who was sort of unresponsive and ask if they got this. after showed them the picture, they said no. and so i left without no indoor shoes.</p>
<p>Then i walk to a coin laundry and do my laundry. while it is laundering, i just sit at the counter charging, using my phone.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20250624_094820.webp" id="20250624_094820" alt="" /><figcaption>6.24 9:48 Here is the laundry machine</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>After laundry done and folded, I walk to the gym. The gym is a public one run by the prefectural government or sth. I enter the building and look for the ticket vending machine thing that i read on google review that was next to the front desk. yeah it was there. I set the language on the machine to english and looked through it. and then i turned to the front desk person and sayed sth like “um <ruby>shitsunai<rt>indoor</rt></ruby> shoes の rental は”… because i saw on google reviews they rent out indoor shoes. and then they sayed stuff in english walk me through rental process. i thought my feet is 23 cm but to be safe i request 24 cm, but they sayed dont have 24 is 25 cm ok and i sayed yes. it turned out 25 cm was just about right i think so luckily i didnt get 23.</p>
<p>in addition to the shoes rental i bought a gym (“training room”) ticket/pass at the machine and handed them the ticket or so, got a receipt telling me what time i need to get out. They say over there is basket to return shoes. and direct me where to find the “training room”. thanks, i leave go.</p>
<p>I go to the locker room where there are some coin lockers. Not many seemed to be used so idk if ppl just dont lock them or sth? idrked but i put my stuff in one and lock it, change my shoes, walk to the “training room”.</p>
<p>I enter the room. Firstly i notice that there are shelves/cubbies u can put bag. so i guess i didnt need to use the lockers in locker room after all. I go over to a mat thing begin to warming up hips, and also take survey of the room observe what is going on.</p>
<p>One thing i noticed is everyone was carry around a little basket with a towel in it, and then they used the towel to clean equipment. Hmm.. I did not have that basket or towel.</p>
<p>I looked at the entrance, there was a table with baskets, and a place to put used towels. But seemingly no fresh towels. I was confused, walked out of room look around a bit, try harder to read all the signs and stuff. But still idk where ppl got the fresh towels. So, i just took a used basket and towel as my own, continue warm up.</p>
<p>i used the facilities and left, go back to locker room to shower. The signs in the shower said to not use soap or shampoo ok i shower without those. Get my stuff, leave, put my shoes in the return basket, and hand my receipt to person at front desk, leave.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Now it is time to eat food. idrk what to eat. I remember i walk by, look at some local-looking place but it was either closed, looked inaccessible, etc., so i decided to walk to a family restaurant that i learned about when googling “fukuoka local chain (restaurants)” on google. it is called “Royal Host”.</p>
<p>At the royal host, i go in and stand in the entrance. someone probably ask if im 1 person, tell me to sit wherever or guide me to a spot. Gave me a menu. Maybe said to ring bell to order.</p>
<p>I look at the menu and wonder what to get. There seems to be many steak and things. I ring bell, someone come over, I order some pork steak meal, as well as a steak rice bowl meal thing. i think the person also ask if i want to order the drink bar (like fountain drinks and stuff) and i (think that i) said sth like uhh.. ok yes pls.</p>
<p>The pork steak meal first comes i eating that. The other stuff comes as well. The guy bring me my last food says something at the end, I am assuming the “nothings missing right?” line. but honestly idrk what hes saying but i generally awkwardly affirm yeah nothings missing and deny no, nothings missing at the same time. they leave.</p>
<p>But then i notice that a soup that was promised to me never came. And also the receipt does not list “drink bar”. hmm. and i already took a drink from the drink bar, a melon soda i think. hmm.</p>
<p>Soup is I thought, maybe i just dont drink the soup. I have enough sodium. But then i think, i will probably never come back to this food place ever again. i will never got to try the soup. So I press the call button and then to the guy i pointing at the “soup” on the receipt and say something like “the soup <ruby>is not yet<rt>mada</rt></ruby>..” and they inference whats up, say “<ruby>not yet come?<rt>kiteinaidesuka</rt></ruby>” or something. i agree, and they dissapear, later bring me my soup. thanks</p>

</figure>
<p>Finish up eating, the soup is pretty nice. i go to pay. As i pay i struggle to say something about the drink bar. i dont even remember what i try to say and the person is kind of confused, but at some point they say ohh ok <ruby>i got it<rt>わかりました</rt></ruby> and i think added some drink to the order and checked me out.</p>
<p>Next on my schedule is to fly on a plane to Okinawa. I take a train to hakata station, i think this is the train where it was cool because the train driver seat was open air, you could see the train driver right there doing they driving routine. That was cool.</p>
<p>I got off at hakata station, there is still some time before the flight. I do not really know what to do to fill an empty time, i was just pace around an exit of hakata station.</p>
<p>It was rainy. i pace aimlessly. There was some people handing out drinks trying to recruit for some idk participation? idk. Then, i saw a wet pigeon. Wow. So i dug out the camera from my bag and take some pictures of the pigeon. And after that, i felt more motivated to do things in life, so i went to the hakata station yodobashi looked at camera stuff and maybe other stuff, i dont really remember.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF5210.webp" id="DSCF5210" alt="" /><figcaption>6.24 14:28 Here was the wet pigeon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then i went to the airport, check in (i think through self kisok), go through security, board flight, fly. For some reason i dont really remember anything about this process. Maybe it was just unremarkable, or i was tired, etc.</p>
<section id="maybe-this-is-where-my-nail-clipper-set-off-their-scanner-thing" class="aside">
<h2>maybe this is where my nail clipper set off their scanner thing</h2>
<p>some time on my trip in a security check, security people pulled my stuff aside. ask me (in english bc i didnt understand they first question they said i think) if i have some kind of blades in my bag, i said no. they said i can search ur bag? ok. they search, pull out my nail clipper, isolate it in a plastic box, do something with it and my stuff (scan separately? idk), put my stuff back together tell me im good.</p>
<p>I dont actually know where this security check was. but i think i remember i had a wet towel in my bag that the security person was sticking they hands in lol so i think it might have been this time, and the towel was moist because i used it earlier dry myself after gym shower.</p>

<section id="my-seatbelt-was-twisted" class="aside">
<h2>my seatbelt was twisted</h2>
<p>i just remembered this episode from reading a note in my notes. i remember i was quite tired sort of dozing off on the plane when a cabin attendant said something like hi ur seatbelt is twisted. i dont actually know if thats exactly what they said but given the context i dont think it was something else because i think they literally like reached down and unbuckled it for me.. i think. i dont really remember, maybe because i was tired.</p>

<p>I arrived at Naha airport and ride the monorail called Yui Rail and got off at some spot. I think google maps said i can take bus or so to my accomodation for the night, but i decide to walk. It is quite warm and humid, and also lots of car exhaust.</p>

</figure>
<p>I arrive at the accomodation. it is like an apartment building where they emailed me the codes to the building, and my room. the checkin was done by filling out a piece of paper they left on room table and leaving it for them to collect later.</p>
<p>The room was like little apartment. it had fridge and induction range and kitchen sink and stuff. I put my stuff down and contemplate what to eat for food.</p>
<p>Look on google maps there seems to be a small restaurant looks approachable near by. So i exit the housing, walk over.</p>
<p>I walk in and someone says to sit at counter i think? so i do that. my only luggage is my camera which i set on the counter to my left. I look at the menu. I forget if it was already at the seat or someone gave it to me. The menu does not seem to have any english on it, or maybe i was just not looking in correct place. But actually i dont think the two? (or three?) servers does not seem to originate from japan, at least remember seeing the appearence and heard them talk to each other in the background.</p>
<p>The servers kind of hovered around me as i look at the menu. Eventually I hit the “i am ready to order” pose and begin to order some food, and the person said uhh drink? (but in japanese) and i said ohh, look at the drinks. i dont really want to drink alcohol because i dont think im recover from jetlag yet. So i choose Cola. And then i order Okinawa Soba and Goya Chanpooloo.</p>
<p>A cold can of coca cola is brought to me along with tall beer mug thing with nice ice in it. I sort of realized that i am probably in an izakaya because the drink order and that they had brought over what appear to be 通し.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<section id="通し" class="aside">
<h2>通し</h2>
<p>通し, which i always read in my mind incorrectly as tsuuji (通じ) but i think is actually to(o)si, i have read about in some article somewhere. apparently they is little appetizers you get at izakaya (bar) that you dont order but they just give to you and you eat as like a form of tax, tip, mandatory spending, whatever. I am guessing the (probably mandatory) drink order is along similar logic, if you dont order drink, maybe your meal is not very profitable. so you must order drink.</p>
<p>idrk what happens if you dont eat 通し or you try to refuse it. im guessing thats just rude but idk because im not japanese and also dont really like izakayas. Also this place they noted on the top of their menu that the 通し was 300 yen.</p>
</section>
<p>I sat in the food establishment sip my cola and eat my appetizer. There seemed to be large chinese? family? large party eating dinner there as well.</p>
<p>My okinawa soba was served first. person said sth like if u want some spicy stuff its up here (gesture to dish of bottles/containers of stuff on counter) oh ok.</p>

<p>i try some of the okinawa soba yum. A nice noodle soup dish. i also tried some of the spicy liquor condiment in the spicy condiment dish that i learned about from anime. oops wow it does have a ethanol fumes! i wonder if i ended up consuming something like half to one shot of liquor consuming that condiment, idrk.</p>
<section id="okinawa-anime" class="aside">
<h2>okinawa anime</h2>
<p>shortly before the trip i watched an anime about okinawa which provided me approx all the cultural knowledge i have in life about okinawa and gave me the ideas of what to eat and try in okinawa this trip.</p>
