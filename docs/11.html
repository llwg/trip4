<p>i woke up and gather things check out. at the front desk after im checking out there is a box of breads. im pretty sure they say its free for you take for breakfast. but im not really sure. i sort of nonverbally ask. but i dont think that really worked. i think i just confused the persons i was trying to nonverbally ask. but end up i take a cheese sausage bread i think, walk back over to okayama station. buy express ticket to “Oboke” station. board the train. it is an Anpanman themed train. i guess because it is headed to “Kochi” and anpanman creator i heard is from Kochi.</p>

<p>I get off train and wait for bus. At this point in trip, i think i am sort of burned out, tired, unmotivated. I just sit wait for bus. Once, i got up and bought my return train ticket. then i sat again wait for bus. I see on google maps now there is cool bridge nearby. but i did not leave station building. i just waited for bus.</p>

</figure>
<p>The bus came. there was some chinese-speaking people on the bus, had bikes. i didnt know you could take bike on bus. the bus drive through windy mountainy road. cool views.</p>
<p>The bus arrives at its final destination, where i get off. According to my many times looking at bus schedules and planning and stuff, i could take more buses to go deeper into the valley and see more interesting tourist attractions and stuff. But i was burned out and tbh didnt really want to keep track of bus schedules when i had to be where and stuff. The buses there too sparse to go wherever whenever you want. so i concluded if i want to go deeper, just come back one day with rental motor vehicle or sth.</p>

<p>And so i just walk around enjoy this bus final destionation. Its main tourist attraction is a bridge made of vines go across river. i took a picture of it and walked down see if i could cross it. but it a money-costing tourist attraction. didnt really want to wait in a line pay money just to cross the bridge once, so i just walk back, walk a little further to where there was some access to the river underneath.</p>

<p>I waded into the river. it was a nice section of river. the water was quite clear. Good current. not too deep. i crossed over to the other side of the river and sat a little. i took out my lens filters and played with them a bit try to use them take some photos. play in the water some.</p>

<p>eventually wade back down the river and exit, walk back to bus stop. still have a little time before bus scheduled departure, so i circle around souvenier shop once. walk over to bus.</p>

<p>the bus is full. or at least configured in such a way that the entrance was blocked with people. there was a family it seems of two parents and two child and they was talking like hmm oh no its full. one of parents said into bus sth like “can u guys move in more”. i stood outside sort of awkwardly watching them somehow manage to squeeze themselves into the bus. looks like there is barely room for me as well so i try squeeze in, seems like feasible. i get off though while waiting because i assume i have to get off when driver comes so he can reach his seat.</p>
<p>another guy around my age comes along as well. uh oh!. oh well. i am sure it will work out. worst case i can just take next bus in uh idk quite a while probably. Driver shows up gets on bus. he says sth into bus i think like “can u guys move in”, i dont think anything rlly changes. but i board bus. guy boards bus. i think another person also came and boarded.</p>
<p>driver says sth to me and gestures to the elevated step area thing leading up to his seat. idk what he said. maybe “u can sit there”? “u can stand there?”? “u can put ur stuff there”?. not really sure, so i didnt really do anything except lean over into it.</p>
<p>and so we drove off, family of four and three(?) people cramped up into front of bus. the good part of this is that i was closest i had even been to front of a driving bus. had front-seat view of bus as it drive through windy road, which was cool. It made a stop where yet another person squeezed on.</p>
<p>Quite crowded. i took out my phone and took video of the windshield view. i heard some chinese kid in the back one time said something like trallalero tun tun tun or sth that latest memes. eventually some people like the family of four got off. and it came my stop, the station. press button, pay, get off.</p>

</figure>
<p>I waited not very long for the train i need, get on. i walk through the free-seating area and all seat pairs seem have at least one person sitting in them, except one with a vape and pet bottle left in it, idk what was up with that so i just stood in deck/part of train between seating areas.</p>
<p>Train ticket person come over and notice me, i give them my tickets and they cancel(?)/mark them and disappear go check the seats. some time shortly later they come back and say to me: hey there is a seat open, and they guide me over to the seat i believe that used to have the vape on it which was now gone, idk if they cleaned it up or what but i said thx and took the seat. thanks train ticket guy!</p>
<p>Train made its way to Kochi where it make it final stop, i get off. I am hungry have not eaten food since the one cheese sausage bread i ate in morning. feel like eat (japanese) chinese food so i look up on google maps. due to forgotten reasoning (too hungry walk elsewhere?), walk over to place that was right outside station. Walk in, worker say something i didnt understand. but based on nonverbal context, guessing it meant “sit wherever you want”. so i did that and nothing bad happened.</p>
<p>looked at menu for a bit, decide what to order, press call bell. i successfully order without any problems. sit there wait. briefly use bathroom. wait more. First, my Bean Sprout Stir Fry and Rice arrive. Then my tantanmen with 3 gyoza and mango lassi set arrive. yummy!</p>

<p>eat, pay at counter, leave. Walk over to hotel, make a brief stop at a convenience store to buy nonalcohol beer and rice crackers as a little snack eat later.</p>

<p>Arrive at the hotel check in reach room. The room was OK except that it smelled like mildew, mold and there i think was visible mold inside the aircon. which was not very OK and i regretted stay at hotel. stay at the kaikatsu Club probably would have been cheaper and less mold. i washed and etc. i ate that chinese food at 3pm so meal timing messed up. i just eat my beer and rice crackers for “dinner”. and i try to go to sleep earlier than usual because i have early plans for tomorrow.</p>
