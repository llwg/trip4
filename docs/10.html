<p>i woke up, got out the club at 10:54, walked up to i think shinsaibashi station, ride one stop to hommachi station, transfer to chuo line riding to Dream island station!</p>
<p>arrive at Dream Island at around 11:39, take some pictures of the cute/cool/funny looking osaka metro 400 series train that i just rode. I walk up the stairs to the World Expo 2025. There were many oodles of people i see entering the expo. i joined the “11:00 and earlier people” crowd (because i had registered for 11:00 entry) and wait in a line. a hot day.</p>

<p>After waiting in the line for a while i reached the security checkpoint. seems you need to take out your liquids to be scanned. so i take out my 2L bottle of water and guava tea bottle i had refilled with the 2L bottle. security man was saying something about cant bring alcohol in so if you have beer drink it now because its a waste of money to not drink it (i think). eventually i was processed by security checkpoint, then scan my QR code ticket thing, enter the world expo. it was about 30 or 40 mins from arrive at train station i estimate.</p>
<p>i walk around the world expo. it may have not been great idea to come on weekend because it was quite crowded. but also i kind of wanted to come on weekend and see the crowds of people because that is sort of interesting in its own experience.</p>

<img src="media/DSCF6790.webp" id="DSCF6790" alt="" /><figcaption>6.29 12:43 They have this pictured large wooden ring structure they made around whole expo. They said it was largest wooden structure in world or something i think. it was quite large. And it was nice to walk under.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>it was sort of like an amusement park. they had many “pavilions” representing different countries. i didnt go to any because they all had lines, and accordinged to my research, many/most require reservation.</p>
<p>i came mainly to see the big wooden structure, look around, eat food. I did see the big wooden structure. it was big and wooden. and so i looked for food.</p>
<p>i stood on side of sidewalk download pdf map from internet. look at it, estimated where i needed to go to find places of food. i go walk there. walk under the big wooden structure because sunlight is quite strong.</p>
<p>find some food-looking place. but it ended up also being some exhibit. i followed crowd and walked through exhibit. at end(?) of exhibit, there were some food places. but mostly like snack, not actually sit down have a meal place. so i left and continued search.</p>
<p>eventually, i found what i probably was looking for. place with many restaurants. since it is world expo, i wanted the non-japanese food. but it was mostly japanese food. there was like one pizza place but idk if it was even marketed as being italian. there was one german food place that looked kind of cool and i wanted to eat the “currywurst” i think it was. but i kept looking, figure i can come back to eat german food if nothing else look more appealing.</p>

</figure>
<p>There was a turkish food place looked pretty good and turkish looking food and turkish looking people working there, so i waited in the line. but the line was kind of really slow. and also there was a german place next door. i heard some ppl behind me discussing that german place saying oh theres not much line and stuff.. and they exited the turkish line went over into that place.. i decided to do so as well. so i gave my menu back to a staff person, went over to the german place.</p>
<p>I wait in the much shorter line look at the menu above. i decide on schnitzel based on some factors like i knew what it was and it was not too expensive and i could manage to read its name in japanese. My turn to order come, i step up to the ordering counter (it actually had a step up) and say can i get a schnitzel. and a (some name of beer). they looked confused. i might have tried to repeat it. they said the beer line is over there (not this line). oh oops. ok just schnitzel pls. the card machine did that thing first time in a while where it asks you what currency you want to use. and ask for your sign. I did that and got my receipt, wait for food, get the food when the number is announced.</p>
<p>Bring food out of restaurant, find a table outdoors. put food down. walk back in to buy beer. stand the beer line look at menu. my turn come, i try say sth like: do you have the daily german beer still. and the person says e.g.: yeah we do, and i reply: ok one pls., and so i purchased one, they gave me a laminated card thing with “hefeweiss” written on it in japanese, and i went up to the beer pouring counter and i didnt really know wtf i was doing there and i kind of looked around looking if im supposed to hand someone the card what am i doing. finally someone on the left who i didnt even notice was doing anything said “heres ur (unintelligible)” and handed my glass of beer. i think the card went in a box, don’t really remember.</p>
<p>Take the beer to my food and begin to eat. They prices was kind of expensive. if i convert the prices to usd, actually probably normal, reasonable restaurant price in usa. but in japan it was like twice of normal restaurant food prices and felt quite expensive. I finish food and drink and bring tray, glass, trash back into restaurant return it, walk out.</p>

<p>I continue to walk around the expo. I went up on the big wooden ring structure, walk around. I was kind of tired and hot, so i sat on a little grassy slope they had on top of the big wooden structure. It had a nice breeze.</p>

<p>i take the escalator down from the big wooden structure, and on the way down there is a building with large sign i think says, “takoyaki 500 yen”. That sounded cool. so i went inside. On the second floor, there was a large food court. seem very standard japanese not very international. i think i saw some takoyaki but i dont think it was 500 yen. for some reason i wanted to try curry udon. so i went over to an udon place. i was sort of intimidated because i had never been to an udon place. Standing there in middle of food court i think i googled on my phone instructions how to eat at an udon place. but the instructions didnt really help or offer any peace of mind. i decide just enter the line. so i go into the line, take the tray. take little plate. put some tempura on my plate. reach the cashier order thing. i try to say one curry udon please. they said something to me i didnt really understand. i dont really remember what happened in that exchange except i think they managed to ask me in english something about if i wanted some kind of rice with my udon and i said ok yes please. they charged me and i exit the cashier line, wait for udon. my order was called and i put my tray on counter and was served two bowls of curry udon. i was confused and think, maybe wrong order. I stood there in shocked and confused state i think, maybe say to the person like, “Uh”. To which i think they said sth like “oh ur rice right? one sec” and then brought over two bowls of rice. but then looking at the receipt, i do see i was actually charged for two curry udons. oh!. oh my goodness!. and so i take my food and leave.</p>
<p>i sit down in a sort of hopeless state. maybe i can give one serving to some random person. but the fact that its food court and ppl probably already order what they want to eat, and the fact that u need to return dish make it feel unfeasible. so i just eat two servings of curry udon with rice.</p>

</figure>
<p>first serving was ok. second serving i kind of felt like throwing up no more curry udon please. but i finished everything. returned my dishes. took a drink of water at the water station. and left.</p>
<p>it was like 3:15pm. i sort of wondered to go walk around see some exhibitions or whatever. but i was kind of exhausted in all ways and want to leave, so i left. and thus my few hours at world expo 2025 came to an end.</p>
<p>i took trains to shin-osaka and then bought shinkansen ticket to okayama. i get on the shinkansen, walk towards the free-seating cars. but they look very packed, ppl are standing outside. i stand as well. at some stop i get off try run over to very front free-seat car to get on. but it looks freaking packed like ppl are literally standing in entry doorway. but departure chime/annnouncement is playing. so i just approach. With cooperation i squeeze myself into the space for a single person standing. the door close, train departs.</p>
<p>finally arrive at okayama, i can get off. i take a bit to sit down. take video of shinkansen leaving. then i leave go walk to my hotel. i find the hotel and go in and check in. they say they got a free drinks in lobby. a cheap alcohol vending machine. and some free bread in the morning. wow! they also had a cute orange seaotter mascot they have plush next to elevator and a painting in the room. but in contrast to the cute seaotter mascot which i have never seen a hotel with a mascot, it also had p*rn on the television configuration. like not even video on demand or sth just flipping through the channels and some of the channel is simply broadcast p*rn, i had never seen a hotel that had that.</p>

<p>i was not particularly thinking of drinking alcohol. but the prices in the alcohol vending machine was cheap. so i just went down and bought some gin(?) lemon sour. and i wash and stuff and eat that lemon sour. i had no dinner. the curry udon was enough. i go to sleep.</p>
