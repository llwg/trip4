<p>Woke up in the hotel, check out the hotel. I am going to the hiroshima atomic bomb dome/peace park area now. Google map say it is short tram ride away. But either i cannot figure out where the tram station is, or i have to walk across the street i dont want to do that, or some other reason, so i end up just walk 30 mins or so instead of take the tram. See the city a bit i suppose.</p>
<p>I arrived there and took a look at the dome. I used the nearby public mans urinal area thing which was unusually open-air, like it wasnt in a full building, just sort of a roof with rough dividers type deal. Interesting setup.</p>
<p>I walked around the area a bit roughly looking at other things relating to the atomic bombing, ww2. It was a park area. have many sidewalks, some grassy dirt area, some trees also.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then i go to the tram station wait for tram back to hiroshima station. I was looking at google maps wondering why the tram routes does not seem to align with the google maps route. and i realized that google maps was telling me a bus route, not tram route. so i was standing on wrong direction tram platform. i went over to other platform.</p>
<p>I ride the hiroshima city tram first time. it looks like it had some QR payment system which was interesting. It also had a IC card payment and cash payment, but seemingly you can only do those at the exits where a human is standing.</p>
<p>I ride the tram. i am a bit anxietous looking at time as tram sits in traffic a bit. I want to make it to a specific shinkansen to kumamoto i think. it might have been a more express faster one that doesnt come very often.</p>
<p>Tram approaching hiroshima station when tram guy at the entrance/exit im standing in front of gets up and moves towards more front of the tram and switches sides. uhh oops!, so i follow him because i need him to pay in cash.</p>
<p>The tram arrives. i think i remember standing there a bit impatient checking the time waiting for i think some fellow tourists figuring out some payment problem. eventually my turn comes i drop my coins in the fare box exit. quicky walk, lightly jog into hiroshima station looking for the shinkansen signs.</p>
<p>I find the shinkansen area and the ticket vending machines, i go over. but there is a sign pointing over to a little maze of those seatbelt-like line divider thingies to form structure for line for the ticket machines to form.</p>
<p>There is only like one other person at the ticket machine or waiting for a ticket machine so i didnt really see a point in walking through the entire empty maze of seatbelts. but the sign says the line entrance is over there!!. so i went over there. i was not completely out of time anyways.</p>
<p>And so i bought my shinkansen ticket to kumamoto, hurried through the gates. the train was pulled into the platform letting people off as i reached the top of the escalators. i boarded successfully.</p>
<section id="what-if-i-just-took-the-next-train" class="aside">
<h2>what if i just took the next train?</h2>
<p>Referencing JR-posted schedules, i think I took the 11:21 mizuho heading towards kagoshima, with total trip time of 96 mins (11:21 to 12:59) to kumamoto.</p>
<p>The next train that goes directly to kumamoto without transfer is the 11:54 sakura that takes 106 minutes (11:54 to 13:40) to reach kumamoto.</p>
<p>But i could also just take any train to hakata (which depart every 5-6 mins from hiroshima), so e.g. 11:28 (hiroshima leave) to 12:30 (hakata arrive). Then take any train to kumamoto (much more irregular, like every 10-30 mins?), e.g. 12:47 (hakata leave) to 13:36 (kumamoto arrive). Then i would arrive at kumamoto at e.g. 13:36 but also get a little 15 minute layover at hakata station to look around inside the shinkansen gates maybe they have those neat stand up noodle stalls can eat some noodles or sth (unknown).</p>
<p>But i made the train so i did not do any of this except first option.</p>
</section>
<p>On the train i was looking up local chain food options again for my destination, kumamoto. I remember i was kind of hungry because i had not gotten any sort of breakfast too busy running around to catch trains, and i would arrive at kumamoto at 1pm without eating anything. As i look through kumamoto local chain foods stuff online i dont exactly remember what i was looking for. I think i might have wanted something not too heavy, lighter on the palate? or something? yet i end up decide let us go to Ramen place, a chain called Ajisen ramen.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8521.webp" id="DSCF8521" alt="" /><figcaption>7.5 12:24 Train was in hakata station and i took this pic because i think it was exact same view i took a picture of last year the huge yodobashi camera sign in the window.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So train arrive at kumamoto station, walk shortly over to a big mall thingy, walk/stand up many escalators up to the food court where there was the ajisen ramen. The menu did not seem very complicated which i always appreciate. The display screen above the food court store stall advertised the “kumamoto set” which included i think the “kumamoto(?) ramen”, fried rice, and 5 dumplings. yummy the whole shebang! priced at a very round easy-to-pay amount of 1500 yen. fantastic.</p>
<p>So i walked up and ordered the kumamoto set and they hit me with the <ruby>ijou de yoroshii desu ka<rt>will that be all for you?</rt></ruby> which i felt like 100 iq when i understood what it mean and i said sth like “yeah”, and then probably they said my total and i probably handed over the cash i had prepared ahead of time because the amount was so round and easy to pay with cash that i could not help but pay it with cash (i think).</p>
<p>They handed me my receipt and buzzer thing as seems to happen at food courts, and so i found a seat and sat down. I fetched some water from the little water station with small paper cups. I also got a table wipe from the table wipe station and wiped my table. And then i got up a little look around the food court, there was some display i think with all the plastic food models of various restaurants in the food court for some kind of uh event i forget what, and the buzzer rang and so i walked over and picked up my food, bring it back to seat.</p>
<p>Even though i always say i do not really like ramen because it tastes like salt noodles, i did enjoy my meal. i think. for me i think the side of (fried) rice or dumplings is half of the experience. and the fact that i got both the fried rice And the dumplings was awesome and great.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20250705_133204.webp" id="20250705_133204" alt="" /><figcaption>7.5 13:32 Wow yummy!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I got up a little go to the pickup counter see if they had the spicy oil i kind of wanted some for my dumplings. they might have had it but looked like it was u probably should have gotten it when u picked up. or maybe didnt have it i dont remember. so i returned to seat, finished meal which was tasty even without the spicy oil or flakes.</p>
<p>I finished my meal, return tray, return table wipe, walk/stand back down escalators exit back to the kumamoto station where i consult google maps, wait for a bus in front of the station. Took some bus to some bus stop somewhere, walked shortly over and reached the kumamoto prefectural gym. Before coming to japan i researched a little what prefectural gyms looked good, and kumamoto’s looked pretty good and also kumamoto is quite big city it appeared which is i think major part of decision why i decided to come here.</p>
<p>I am a bit anxiety as i walk across street to the gymnasium, up a few steps, through the little concrete garden type deal it has in front of entrances. The bottom floor is large wall-window type stuff looking into the building. I see (one of the?) glass doors propped open and so i walk through it enter the building. i did not take any photos, but from my memory it was quite a warm or cozy vibe and i was not too sure why. From looking at google maps review pictures to remember what it looked like, i think what contributed to this was the floor tiled with small greyish-brown square tiles. the reddish brown, moderately low ceiling. the beige(?), textured pattern of the inner walls and supporting pillars. and the way these earth-colored elements glowed softly as they illuminated by the sun enter through the large ceiling to floor window walls outlooking the concrete garden thing.</p>
<p>I was entered but did not know where to go. so i look around, and i see a window/counter thing, so i walk over to engage with the human behind the window, and i think they slide the window open and i try to mumble something like “<ruby>トレーニング室は<rt>the training room</rt></ruby>”, except i said training-ya instead of training-shitsu because i always misread 室(shitsu)(room) thought it is 屋(ya)(i guess because 部屋). But i dont think that mattered, im guessing the main word is “training” which i did say and mumbled the rest, and the person understood and explained something like the training room is here on the map and you buy entry thing via vending machine there. ok that makes sense thanks!, and so i agree and probably mumble thank you and leave to find the training room (gym).</p>
<p>I walk over and find it. I see it, and it is the same as i saw in the google map reviews photos. The entrance is a fake green turf thing and tell you to take off ur outdoor shoes. So i sit in one of the chairs take off my sandals, open my “snorkeling socks” i bought at miyakojima donquihote. put on my regular socks, and then my snorkeling socks over my regular socks.</p>
<p>I walk over to the vending machine and bought my ticket. it was four hundred something yen i think which felt kind of steep compared to the prefectural gym i went to in fukuoka which was two hundred something yen i think. There was a coin-operated lockers in front of the room entrance. but i wondered if people brought their bags in and there are cubbies inside the room as was the case in fukuoka. I stalled for a bit stared at the lockers a bit until someone else is going ahead of me, i believe an older guy who was carrying a tote bag. so i watched a little and he bring that tote bag in, so I assumed i am good to bring my backpack as well, and so i went in after them.</p>
<p>i handed my ticket to the guy at the desk (which i saw the older guy do as well). he took the ticket and gave me in return a laminated card and said something which i interpreted to mean “ok ur time starts now”. and so i turned to walk in, but then guy said something which honestly im not sure what he said but i heard words like “indoor shoes” and guessed interpreted he was asking if i was wearing indoor shoes. i held up my foot(s) up a little in a pose you might do if showing off ur shoes to someone and tried to say something like “are these OK” and i dont actually remember him confirming they are OK so much as he didnt say anything that was disagreeing with me. So i interpreted this as i am OK to go, so i walk in.</p>
<p>I stretch a little on a yoga mat that is in front of a mirror. the mats seem to be lain out in such a configuration that suggests they were lain there by staff and people are supposed to come, use them, leave them there when done. Peoples bags are against a wall. so i put my own bag against wall as well.</p>
<p>I observe the things happening in gym as i stretch. Is there anything similar to the thing in fukuoka gym where everyone carrying around a little basket and microfiber cloth to clean equipment? No, it does not seem so. Then how do people clean the equipment? I am not sure.</p>
<p>I finish stretch and got up. There does not seem to be any wipe or cloth or cleaning solution nearby. So i just leave the mat without cleaning it or anything, which felt sort of strange and off-putting. I head over to the machine area. But it looks like people carry their bags around with them to each machine and stuff. so i fetch my own bag do the same.</p>
<p>I use one machine for a bit, reading all the signs pasted all over the machine and stuff. it seems that they leave (dry) towels at each machine and that is what ur supposed to wipe the machine with. hmm i see. so i finish using the machine wipe the dry machine with my dry towel which idk really accomplished anything but i moved on.</p>
<p>I moved on to the dumbbell and bench area did some whatever stuff, still trying to assess what is up at the gym. There were also little towel cloths here, looks like same deal please wipe the stuff down after u use it. There was a spritz bottle of alcohol sanitizer but i remember it had a sign saying dont put this on the wipy towels!!, so i didnt.</p>
<p>Eventually made my way over to the squat rack thing area. The racks were the nonadjustable kind, there is like a staircase of hights, one at waist level, one slightly higher, and one i guess the tallest they expect anyone will need. i um do start to do a light squats but then i stopped because actually they have a weightlifting area like an area that u do snatches and clean and jerks and can supposedly drop it on the floor and stuff. i think to do that but first i went back to dumbbell area and warmed up a little doing some other stuff and then came back to weightlifting area.</p>
<p>i am more used to women 15kg bar because i am still new to weightlifting had been learning with a womens bar. They had 15kg bar but seemed to have same (28mm?) thickness of mens bar but i used it anyway. It was very shiny, sharp knurling, seemed not very used.</p>
<p>i had a fun little time practice snatch a bit. i felt a little self conscious because i am both baby, beginner weightlifting and doing it first time in public in any country. i made sure to lower weight instead of dropping it to avoid risk of someone talking to me. they did not have 5kg bumper plates so i sort of jumped up to 10kg bumpers more quickly than i would have liked to do with my current experience (35kg was very close to my comfortable maximum), but it was surprisingly OK, especially after not weightlifting for two or more weeks. and also the 10kg bumpers were a nice green color which delighted me because i had never used those color-coded bumpers before.</p>
<p>They also had blocks which i had never used before so i tried snatching from them which was a cool new unfamiliar experience. They also had little tin boxes of chalk which was cool because i had never used chalk while holding a barbell. i wasnt going to use it because i figured i wasnt lifting heavy enough to actually have chalk make any difference. but there was some random chalk particles on the blocks which i wiped off end up get chalk on my hands anyways so i tried apply some chalk try it out. It indeed didn’t really feel any much different. idk because light weight, didnt chalk enough, very sharp knurling, or what.</p>
<p>It was a fun time except when my glasses accidentally fell of my face and broke yet again, cracked in a different place on same side which separated frame into two distinct pieces instead of just one with a crack. That was unfortunate but in a rest period i managed to tape it all back together with some of that “paid-for” tape that i got from i think a seven eleven, had stuck it on a water-bottle i bought label (i specifically saved that label in case i needed more of that paid-for tape). I also ripped a callus im guessing some time when lowering the very sharp barbell. it stung a bit. but luckily i have band aid so i use it tape over it.</p>

</figure>
<p>I finish after some undetermined time. no real plan just finish when vibes determine it is time to finish done enough things. I do a few sets of squats. and i leave. Hand my slightly-accidentally-bent laminated card back to the guy when exiting. i expected him to scan it or something verify i hadnt gone over time or something because there is a barcode on it. but no he just lets me go so i go.</p>
<p>When walking back out into the fake grass entry hallway, I noticed i accidentally left the tag of my snorkeling socks on the chair i sat on later. oops!. i picked that up.</p>
<p>I entered a changing/shower room. There were some showers. The farthest shower seemed to not work. I took a short shower in the second farthest shower. change into fresh (under)clothes, leave the change shower room, put on my shoes i fetch from the cubby in the hallway where i stored them, put them on, and walk down the hallway back towards where i initially came from.</p>
<p>I am walking and see a vending machines. Hmm i could go for a sports drink seems yummy. So i got a pocari sweat. I also got a “calorie mate” which i have seen before in various places but never tried yet. I take my items and sit on a bench across from these vending machines in the quiet hallway, eat my Pocari Sweat and Calorie Mate. The pocari sweat tasted like pocari sweat (sweet electrolyte drink). The calorie mate tasted like a block of compressed flavored almond flour.</p>

</figure>
<p>Finished my snack, i walked out wait for a bus that google maps say would come. It was a bit hot and sunny. I stood in the shadow of the bus stop sign. Some other people also showed up and stood around while they waiting for the bus. The bus come and ride the bus.</p>
<p>I ride the bus over to some shopping area. One of those roofed shoppping streets. I came over to this area because it had both</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>donquihote</p></li>
<li><p>some restaurant i decided to go to</p></li>
</ol>
<p>First i walk over through the roofed shopping streets. a quite lively/busy atmosphere on the saturday at around 5pm, i think. Walk over to the restaurant, paused a little to look at the menu posted outside, probably decide what i would get based on how big and representatively it was displayed on that menu.</p>

</figure>
<p>I walked into the restaurant without much thought. someone might have told me u can sit here so i sat there. As i might remember it, the ordering exchange went like this: they bring over the free water and say lmk when ur ready to order. i nonverbally made a pose “oh im actually ready to order” type pose and say sth like “hamburg&amp;steak please”. and they say “you want the <ruby>tanpin<rt>à la carte</rt></ruby>? or set?”, and gestured to the part of menu that had an option “salad set”, “soup set”. oh i didnt know you could got that. so i said, “oh the soup set (please)” and they probably said ok and left. or actually maybe they asked a follow up question do u want ur rice normal size? and i said large rice i think.</p>
<p>But anyways amazingly i successfully ordered and responded to basic questions without losing my mind which was great. i felt great and comfortable and minimal anxiety i think at that time. I used the bathroom which was small but a nice bathroom overall.</p>
<p>The server brought over a little basket of silverware. And some time later, soup. or maybe it was the other way around. I tried the soup. it was creamy, and i think tasted like corn. i guess it was corn soup. And then they brought over the hamburg and steak and rice. and when they done serving they asked me something i did not hear or understand. i really dont know what they said. maybe it was “was that everything you ordered?”, maybe it was “do u want anything else?”, maybe it was “do u want me to cut ur steak for you” or “do you like trains” or something, i really dont know and i paused awkwardly in the moment of understandingness and sort of looked at them awkwardly and cluelessly and they looked back maybe also sort of helpless, clueless as well (maybe). and so i responded, <ruby>dai jou bu desu<rt>im good</rt></ruby>. and they said oh you good? and i said yeah and they said ok and left.</p>
<p>I sat there and ate my meal. since the restaurant is called “center river hamburg and steak”, i got the “hamburg and steak”. two little hamburg steak meatballs and a little bit of steak and some bean sprouts and corn and a little itty bitty potato.</p>

<p>tbh without any sauce it tasted quite tasteless. idk if it was seasoned at all. i guess the idea was for you to sprinkle the sauces that is at the table onto it. i sprinkled some on and it was okay i guess. the server i think once refilled my water and once came by to take my basket of silverware but saw i hadnt taken knife or something out yet and so said oop!, didnt take it. i also remember some person came into the restaurant and walked in to the door across from the bathroom which i think i remembered was staff only room and came out looking and acting like a staff, so i guess they was beginning they shift.</p>
<p>i completely ate my food and got up take my payment slip to the front counter where i paid. the person asked me something which i was pretty sure “do u want ur receipt”. i said uhh and thought for a moment, idk about what and then said ok yes pls and so they handed over my receipt which was sort of lightly wrapped around a free drink voucher and i said thx and left. I think i saw them wrap the receipt around the voucher before asking if i wanted the receipt so i wonder if i just wouldnt have gotten the drink voucher if i said no thx dont need my receipt. they also made no mention of the drink voucher as they handed it over under my receipt.</p>
<p>I walked over to the Donquihote in search of a souvenier hat to replace my lost hat or just some neat souvenier or idk what. I walked up and around and about but tbh there unexpectedly did not seem to have many souvenier except a rack at the entrance which didnt have anything that caught my eye. so i left.</p>
<p>I am walking back out where i came from when i saw a sign for <ruby>Muji<rt>無印良品</rt></ruby> wow i love that store. so i went in browsed around. there were some small cloths labelled as dish cloths that were only 499 yen for 12 i think and so delightfully simple and nifty. do i really need these small cloths? maybe not. But they are only 499. and maybe they will improve my quality of life in various ways. and also i havent bought any souveniers or nothing in japan. im all the way over here i should bring something home should i not?. and so after indecision a very long time about what variety of the various dishcloths to buy i picked out the 12 pack 499 yen ones, stood in line at the human register (there was apparently no self register). and paid for my towels with a single 500 yen coin, receiving back a nice little 1 yen coin in change.</p>
<p>I exit the muji/little department store thingy that the muji was in. Next i wanted to visit a book store. maybe i can buy a cheap used comic books i didnt read enough of in the club. But dont seem to be a used book store close by so i crossed the street to a different continuation of the shopping street. there was a person sort of like uh high on life(?) type vibe strolling around announcing very loudly to random womans and groups of womans in general stuff like “Wow you are very pretty! Wow Kumamoto full of beauties! Please go out with me!”, et cetera.</p>
<p>I found the new book store and walked around without a desire to buy anything and so i left and decide its time to go to my next destination which is Miyazaki because my flight back home tomorrow afternoon starts from Miyazaki.</p>
<p>My main plan i had planned for in general based on browsing google maps is to take train to Shin-Yatsushiro and then google maps says there is a bus that goes pretty frequently to miyazaki?. so i plan to do that. but when i checked at this moment, google map also seem to say sth like there is some kind of intercity bus that stops right at the shopping street area thing i was at?. hmm. So i think, maybe i try to take that bus.</p>
<p>I am at the bus stop, a quite big bus stop with a large posting of various schedules. i think i look through schedules try find the one im thinking of taking. i think i did find it. but also i need to go to the bathroom and i have a few mins before bus comes. but not many minutes. unsure if i should try to rush inside some nearby department-store-esque building use bathroom.</p>
<p>I decide to try, and so i hurry inside, find bathroom, use, hurry back out still with like 1 or 2 minutes remaining, great. I do see the bus i was looking for pull up. but looking at the entrance it does not give of vibes of a bus you can just get on by beeping your ic card no ticket. Intercity buses you probably need a ticket.. right..?</p>
<p>I am pondering this, wondering if i should ask driver about it as i feel the time ticking. this is quite a busy bus stop dont seem like bus will be here very long. i am still wondering as i see bus close its doors and take off. oh well.</p>
<p>So i resume original plan of go to shin-yatsusiro take bus from there. I go to a tram station that google maps suggests. im still trying to figure out exactly what tram im supposed to take as a tram pulls up. it seems that theres two different lines, A and B line? idk which line tram this one is. people is getting on. so i just get on.</p>
<p>It turns out i got on the wrong one. one of the two doesnt go to kumamoto station oopsies. so i just wait for next major-ish stop where a bunch of people get off and i follow the small crowd off so i dont have to force myself up through crowded tram alone.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8567.webp" id="DSCF8567" alt="" /><figcaption>7.5 18:55 Standing in the back of the tram</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>i get off the tram. according to google maps, the train i need to/can take is some time away departing from kumamoto station, and i can fit in like a 30 min or so walk to the station from where i am at currently. so i opt for that instead of try to catch another tram.</p>
<p>I walk through a busy commercial area then through quieter streets. taking some pictures. i see a cat. i see some people taking looks like wedding photos. the sun sets as i walk. The walk ends up being slightly longer than i expect, and towards the end i jog towards station so that i do not be late.</p>

<p>I make to the station and to the train. Im in the train go to take a seat. there is a pole seat (seat next to a pole) free, though the seat next to it has a backpack on the floor in front of it. i dont really care tbh bc its not directly in front of the pole seat anyways so i just sit there in the pole seat. but when train is closer to departure some young baseball-looking boys (have buzz cuts and baseball glove) come and take the seats. I think either the two seats next to me or the two seats next to the seat next to me. Or maybe they were already already in the two seats next to the seat next to me, i forget. but someone that looks like their friend came on slightly later it looks like they was expecting to sit in the spot i was sitting. the boy next to me said sth like “go sit over there” or sth to them and so that friend that came later went sit over there, and i felt slightly bad like hopefully i didnt contribute to bad social energy between these boys. but also i felt slightly relieved like i didnt have to deal with a verbal confrontation dealing with uhh actually can i have that seat or something.</p>
<p>On the train i am using phone looking up details of bus i am about to take and discover it seems to be.. reservation only.. it seems to specifically be bus used in tandem with shinkansen you like start from hakata ride shinkansen to shin-yatsushiro transfer to that bus with your same ticket and go to miyazaki. oh no..</p>
<p>But i am not entirely sure maybe um.. maybe i can buy ticket or something at shin-yatsushiro? idk.. i remain a little hope.</p>
<p>The train arrives at shin-yatsushiro and i get off. quite an empty station at this time. walk down. i realize the ticket office is closed cant help me with anything. the ticket machine doesnt seem to be able to buy ticket for that bus.. oh no.. oops.. i sit in the station wondering what to do. i guess most feasible thing is to take shinkansen to kagoshima sleep there and take early train to miyazaki tomorrow.. but i dont want to waste even more money taking shinkansen again..</p>
<p>i sit there. the time that the bus would come passes; i did not bother to find its stop outside. i decide ok well i guess i will go to kagoshima. and so i insert credit card into the ticket machine buy my ticket to kagoshima. enter the gates in the empty station. use the bathroom. take a picture of the empty station. wait for shinkansen to come. take it to kagoshima.</p>

<p>I arrive at the kagoshima central station at some time like 9:43pm. I walk over to my good old friend Kaikatsu Club, walking through a bit of nighttime city scenery while doing so.</p>

<p>Arrive at the club. there was a self register which was convenient. there was also a human behind the counter which was actually sort of awkward because due to the extreme self-service nature of the club. i silently check in, scanning my membership card which makes like that microsoft powerpoint sparking glitter sound, get my receipt, put it in a card lanyard thing they have, scan my way into my room.</p>

<h2>the extreme isolation feeling of the club</h2>
<p>The kaikatsu club always kind of feels super isolational to me. It feels like even the staff ignores the customer and vice versa because idk it just feels like that vibe. like everyone is there to have alone time and so every interaction with a person is slightly more awkward than usual, maybe. im not really sure. idk. but in my time at this club especially i passed a staff member a handful of times while out and about doing stuff in the club and it always sort of felt like neither of us acknowledged each other’s existences.</p>

<p>I saw a USB3.0 card reader in a baskets of stuff you could borrow during ur stay so i used that card reader and i was transferring photos and it was so much faster than the little usb2.0 dongle i had been carrying around. i also took shower, brush teeth, drink a water from the drink bar. and go to sleep.</p>

<h2>this club’s slippers</h2>
<p>i am remembering this because i took a picture of them. My room in this kaikatsu club had super new slippers were barely broken in. felt brand new.</p>
