<p>Today was the last day i am in japan. I wake up in the club, probably to my alarm that i had set yesterday calculated to have enough time to get out and walk to train station to catch train time.</p>
<p>I return the card reader and two fleece towels and take a drink of water from the drink bar and sign out, walk to Kagoshima station to catch train to Miyazaki.</p>

<p>I arrive at the kagoshima station. I have actually visited this station before and have some memory of the surrounding scenery so it was interesting to return. I saw some trams which i didnt know were there. and then i walk up the station steps and realize/remember that the JR kagoshima station, despite being named the name of the city, is quite small, smaller than the “kagoshima central” station. There was a single ticket vending machine there so i bought my ticket to miyazaki. And i had a bit of time left so i hurried over to a nearby lawson i passed to buy some food to eat on the train, slightly afraid i will miss train but also pretty confident i will not.</p>

<p>At the convenience store i picked out several breads: mayonnaise bread, salt yakisoba bread, and melon bread. and also a 1L bottle of water. there was a self register, how convenient. i selfed registered it all into a bag and head back to station. At the station i sort of wonder what was in a little waiting room on the side, so i went and looked at the vending machine selection and left, i think noticing a homeless person in the corner of my eye sitting in the corner of the waiting room but i didnt actually turn to look or verify. i have seen homeless people in japan occasionally in larger cities but it was first time seeing or thinking i might have seen one on this trip. when i leave, i sort of wonder if i should have offered one of my breads or sth but idk homeless people vibes or culture in japan or japanese or if i actually saw a homeless person, so i went on.</p>
<p>I made my way down to the appropriate platform. the train arrive, and i take the train. The train was mostly empty. I picked a seat, sat down, open the back-of-seat table, eat my breads.</p>
<p>Each bread sort of tasted like like they looked and sounded like. The mayonnaise bread sort of moist and squishy steamed bread type of bread with some mayonnaise flavor maybe mixed in the bread dough itself? and maybe a bit of mayonnaise applied inside as well. And the bread is wrapped around a bit of ham like its a cinnamon roll except instead of goopy cinammon sugar stuff its ham. The Salt Yakisoba bread is basically just salted spaghetti in a roll with a little black pepper and parsley(?or cilantro? idk) seasoning i think. And the melon bread–i dont even remember if ive eaten melon bread before but it just tasted like melon bread. sweet, melon flavored bread. no filling or anything. just melon flavored bread.</p>

<p>The train arrived at Miyazaki station and i got off the train. I go to exit through the gates as i think one does by putting ur limited express seat ticket and fare ticket together in at once into the ticket slot. but then the little gate door thingies closed on me made a bad sound, the little screen said sth like check with station staff or something, and most strangely it did not return the tickets. it just ate them. hmm??</p>
<p>Some station person saw what was happening and came over. i dont really remember what they said or what i said. i think asking me like um u put in ur tickets? yeah i did it ate it. luckily i think they asked me questions in such a way that i could answer without having to actually formulate complex answers. they asked me sth like u put tickets in? where you came from? i think i forgot where i came from lol and opened phone showed them pic of my tickets i took picture of on the train. And they said sth like oh kagoshima? and opened the side of the gate to a little box that it appears all the eaten tickets go to. they dug out my tickets and looked at them and said ok u can exit (through that side-entrance thing that goes by the station office), and so i did.</p>
<section id="theories-of-why-it-was-had-problem" class="aside">
<h2>theories of why it was had problem</h2>
<p>looking at that pic i took of my tickets i notice now that my limited express seat ticket was to south miyazaki instead of miyazaki, i wonder if that is why i had a problem. Or maybe because my tickets was never cancelled(?) on the train bc there was no ticket checker person for some reason. idk.</p>
</section>
<p>Im in the miyazaki station its slightly after 10 and my flight is at 11:20 so its time already to get going to the airport. i think i will take the airport bus. but after looking online at the bus information, it is sort of unclear where i am supposed to go in miyazaki station to take this bus. i walk around outside sort of confused. google maps does not even seem to know the bus exists it seems, even though from the schedules and stuff on the website i am pretty sure it exists. i walk back in and wonder if i should just take the train. but it seems the only train that goes to it is a limited express train? and for some reason i couldnt buy the limited express ticket on the ticket machine??.</p>
<p>It is getting sort of close to time that i must get going otherwise risk missing flight. so i go over to the desk labelled tourist information and said something like uhh where is the <ruby>kuukou bus noriba<rt>airport bus stop</rt></ruby>. there was a short period after i said this to the lady behind the desk and it sort of looked like she was confused had no idea what i was saying, and then she pulls out a sheet of paper and then says its different each time. are u going asap? and i said yeah and they said ok well next one is at 10:30 and she highlighted the 10:30 bus on the sheet of paper and say its at platform 3 which is out the west exit over there etc. ok that makes sense i was nodding and agreeing when the other lady behind the counter said do u want some tape to fix ur glasses it looks u cant see and i said oh oops haha ok thanks nonverbally and cut took the piece of scotch tape they pulled out for me on the tape dispenser they put on the counter. i replaced the tape on the top part of my glasses with the scotch tape because that is the one that kept coming undone the most. the tape lady said can u see? and i agreed. i may have even said, “I can see”. and i think they said do u need some for the bottom part? and i said im good, and i say thank you, and i back away from the counter and leave.</p>

<p>I go to the bus platform/stop 3 that the person had tell me is the bus, and the posted schedule did say the bus will come, great. I waited and the bus came and i got on the bus. fantastic.</p>
<p>I ride the bus to the airport and go into the airport and check-in and security and board the plane. On the plane i was in the situation where i am a window seat so i nonverbally announce my existence and stand apologetically as the aisle seat person notices and gets out of their seat. this is when a cabin attendant asked me something. honestly i had no clue what they said and based on context i guessed they was saying something like oh is that ur seat ur waiting to get into? and so i just agreed. and as i was sitting down i noticed they was opening the overhead bin and i realized they probably asked if i wanted to put my backpack in the overhead bin. I was in my seat already now and they asked me again, i think something like uh ur bag? and so i said oh im good and they said oh ur good? and i said yeah thanks haha and so they re-closed the overhead bin. that was a bit of an oopsies.</p>

</figure>
<p>When the plane had landed in Tokyo they was making some announcement in japanese, something sounded like please close the windows because some kind of reason, and i wondered if i heard correctly because there was no subsequent english announcement or anything. I was a window seat and i did notice some people were closing windows so i did it as well.</p>
<p>I got off plane and stuff. in the long hallway of walking, i saw there was a sign saying “international transfers” or something like that, so i wondered if i go there because i do have an international flight next. I walk towards this direction but then stop and pause because i remember i dont think i have my boarding pass yet. so i turn around going to head out the other exit direction. An airport worker standing behind a little podium noticed me doing something and asked me something which i didnt understand. I thought for a little and concluded, hmm this is tokyo and its haneda airport, very global. maybe i should assume they speak english. so i said in english something like “I don’t have my boarding pass, do I need to exit to go to the check-in counters”. The person looked at me blankly a little and then reached for looks like some electronic device im guessing to translate. so then i said Uh <ruby>touzyouken<rt>boarding pass</rt></ruby>.. <ruby>mada inai<rt>dont got it yet</rt></ruby>..(desu)– and they sort of complete my thought for me, say oh <ruby>inai<rt>you dont got it?</rt></ruby>(desuka)? and i said <ruby>yeah<rt>hai</rt></ruby> uh <ruby>counter<rt>kaunta-</rt></ruby>… and then they explained something (in japanese) about the check-in counters and the third floor, i assume it was about yeah u gotta exit go to checkin counters on third floor.</p>
<p>ok thanks, so i did exit, and i went to the third floor, where there was only ANA checkin counters which left me very confused and i walked around a bit hopeless in circles check online what is going on, etc. for some time coping with the fact i should probably ask someone for help again. so i approached someone and said um checkin counter.. and they said yeah its right there and i said oh yeah but uh.. and think i was trying to make an effort with japanese but saying “united (airlines)” in japanese pronunciation felt so weird and i ended up just saying “United” in an obscenely american way to confirm that i dont know japanese, and so they started explaining in english oh uh united is not here its terminal uh three or something, and they brought over a map and showed me that it is in terminal three after telling me it is in terminal three, and i said ohh ok.. there was a brief moment where they had finished explaining and i said ohh.. and i think they said or wondered aloud sth like “can you make it?” but in japanese, i think they said “ikeru?”, though i dont actually know japanese so idk if thats actually what they said or if it makes sense in this context.</p>
<p>So i said ok thanks and left, walked back down the escalators. i felt a bit urgent and hurried, i power walk and/or lightly jog around looking for the bus between terminals. i find it, take bus to terminal three. the checkin kiosk doesnt work for me. i go to a person and explain in english im on a shared flight booked under ANA and then they said sth like ohh umm i think u already checked in though? or something. idrk. but they gave me my boarding pass thank you, and i went through security but remembered i had a bottle of sunscreen spray in my backpack. i think it actually might have been under the limit and maybe i could have brought it on plane. but i just went to bathroom dump the spray in the sink which was not a great idea because it did not look very water soluble.</p>
<p>But eventually i got through security. i walked around looking for some refrigerated chocolates that coworker requested and bought those after walking around a bunch. there either did not seem like enough time for a proper meal and/or all of the meal places looked quite busy would take a while and/or i wanted to make a final convenience store stop, so i went to i believe the only convenience store in the post-security area, a small seven eleven. it had a long line and was crowded. i take a basket, squeeze around some people. pick out some breads and some alcohol and stand in line to check out. reach over grab a bottle of water and some jellies add to basket while i wait in line.</p>
<p>And so i had my stuff, and i walk over to my gate, where the flight is boarding. I sit in an empty seat and crack open a cold one and stuff my face with bread–noodle bread, curry bread, and white fish and tartar sauce bread as i watch the people boarding the flight. After done consuming my bread and drink, I discard my wastes and join the line, board the plane. This ends my trip.</p>
