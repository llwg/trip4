<p>Reach station and buy ticket, board train for Imabari, arrive at imabari. My plan is to rent bicycle and ride the “Shimanami Kaido” to Honshoo japan. IIRC there was a bike rental place right by the Imabari station, but from google reviews or sth i read something about people complaining there was no bikes or idrk. And also there was some distance between Imabari station and the start of “Shimanami Kaido”, so i figure maybe i just go to the rental bicycle place that is Closer To The Start of the Shimanami Kaido.</p>

<h2>Shimanami Kaido</h2>
<p>Shimanami Kaido i am told is a long bike trail(s) that goes across this patch of many islands in the setonaikai.</p>
</section>
<p>So, i take a bus towards the area. But along the bus ride, i realize i will probably soon have to use the toilet, so i get off at a slightly different place plan on walking to nearby train station go use their toilet.</p>
<p>Get off walking to the station, oh man really got to go! dangerous. I desparately plod along, following the awkward route around a block of buildings to reach the station. I cut through some strange side path that connects into station parking lot where i see station, and realize: oh wait not all stations have bathrooms. small unmanned ones wouldnt have them would they.</p>
<p>And so there was no toilet. How unfortunate. I wonder what will happen now. Then i remember shopping places probably have public toilets. So i look up nearby shopping place. I walk towards it.</p>
<p>I walking towards it. Some old guys in a car was stopped and asked me from they car if i knew where something was. i dont think i even understood what they were looking for but i stood there sort of like thinking or just frozen in the headlights and looked confused and or tried to say sth like <ruby>wakkannai<rt>idk</rt></ruby> desu and they said like oh u dont know? ok np bye, and i agreed and went on my way.</p>
<p>I walk up to the shopping thing and there was a grocery store so i enter and circle around inside desparately looking for the bathroom. i didnt see it. i wonder if i ask someone. but despite my desparation i still felt hesitancy. so i did not. and also for some reason my need to go felt slightly less. i was not sure why. I had a bad feeling that maybe it was already too late.</p>
<p>I exited the grocery store and looked to my left, where i saw the bathroom signs. I walked into the bathroom. into the toilet stall. And discovered it was too late. Unfortunate. I did my best to handle the situation.</p>
<p>After handle, i continue on to the bike rental place. It was just walk to it. More than 30 mins walk i think. Not a particularly pleasant walk. Kind of felt like the middle of nowhere, especially considering its a bike rental place.</p>

</figure>
<p>I reached the bike rental place. from google maps guidance it looked like i had to walk through a whole bunch of windy road and parking lots or something. but i saw this strange overgrown footpath up a hill that looks like it goes in same direction, so i used that try to do a shortcut. idk if i actually saved any time, but eventually i found the bike rental place.</p>
<p>The place and surrounding area was kind of empty and concrete. They had a bathroom so i went in it and used it as i mentally prepare to rent the bike.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF7856.webp" id="DSCF7856" alt="" /><figcaption>7.3 12:40 strange weird empty concrete area thing looking out to bridge</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I went over to the counter thing labelled as bike rentals and tried to say sth like “do you have any electric assist bikes still” (but in japanese) and the lady replied something in japanese which i dont really remember, but i think something like “the application to do the rental is you scan this QR code” and i say oh ok and took out my phone and scan it, which bring me to some online form i can select english language, fill it out, i think it gives me a further QR code? that i show them? and by this time they have figuren out that idk japanese and uh tell me stuff like um how much money i have to pay and what time the place im riding to will close and stuff like that in english.</p>
<p>And so they gave me a bunch of literature and a receipt that i am to bring over to the bike depot guys who take receipt, pull out the bike, adjust seat to approx my height. i remember feeling kind of awkward and idk in what manner or style or language i should try to be replying and reacting to the bike depot guys when they say things to me, like when they say things like “oh ok you got [bike]!”, “wait a moment!”, “here is your bike!”, and explaining various parts of the bike. I guess i just nod and try to look cute.</p>
<p>i think the bike depot fellows told me the direction to take to start the Shimanami Kaido, and after explaining things they sent me on my way. i think they said to turn right so i turned right, and i think that was right.</p>
<p>I started the bike at approx 1PM, and i must return bike at destination at 7PM. According to random person google review that say they started at like 12:30? and finish at 6pm visited a place in between, i estimate i can do it. And also it says 69KM at the beginning. and so as long as i ride more than average speed of 69/6=11.5 km/h, i should be OK. and based on my previous biking i estimate this should be OK.</p>
<p>And so i make my way along the Shimanami Kaido. Ride up to bridge, across the bridge, down the bridge, across the island. Back up to bridge, across bridge, etc. Occasionally stop, take pics, get a drink, take a rest, et cetera.</p>

<p>I did this for a few many hours. The recommended bike path is pretty clearly marked with signs and blue bike lines and i think i only made a wrong turn once. And turned back pretty soon because the lack of blue line made me worry.</p>
<p>nothing very exciting happened. here were a few mildly memorable moments</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At some point i rode into what looked like a rest spot. Plan to have a drink, buy a drink, use bathroom, or something. But when i pull up in front of a vending machine i realized that this spot had a bike rental place seemed to be part of the like giant shimanami kaido rental agency association thing. and someone in the window saw me and i think came to attention and so i tried to like act like i did not require their services or something. i think they said sth. also in english i think. um. i think i tried to nonverbally communicate from afar at the vending machine uhh no im just here to do idrk but not return bike or anything like that!, but idk if that really was communicated so i simply turned around and left feeling quite awkward.</p></li>
<li><p>some guy(s) on autobike passed me going downhill on a portion of the infrastructure that was shared auto+not auto bike. they did that thing that where u hold up ur arm not really waving but sort of greeting the person that u are passing. I encountered them again at the bottom of the hill when i was crossing the road, i think they was the ones that stopped let me cross the crosswalk. i think the last guy who i dont remember holding they arm up at me the first time passing i belive held they arm up at me this time.</p></li>
<li><p>there was some sections where it was ride on a sidewalk thing right on edge overlooking sea. That was cool to ride along. also there was a few accesses to the sea. I stopped at one which was just the manmade concrete stairs lead directly down the side of the concrete edge, dipped my feet in the sea a little. walk back up continue cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>I passed by several convenience stores along the way. i stopped by one but i think they didnt have wet wipes that i wanted so i kept going, sometimes passing by another ones but dont stop for some reasons like “i think lawson(?) had the wipes i wanted so i will ride until i reach a lawson”, “i will ride until i come across store with self register”, “i will ride until i find a seven eleven who has the easier payment kiosk”, et cetera., always avoid buying for some random anxiety or procrastination or another. Eventually i bought stuff at a Familymart. Some wet wipes (i was soon run out), nonalcoholic beer, and “japanese style tuna bread”. I took my stuff and rode a bit farther until found random bench on side of road to sit at and ate my tuna bread and beer. Tuna bread kind of tasted more like cheese and bread than tuna or japanese style. as i ate i remember hearing sounds of students which gave me a sort of anxiety thinking they might walk past and judge me stuffing my face with tuna bread and beer next to my little rental bike. but nobody walked past.</p></li>
<li><p>I was temporarily stopped and put my phone on my backpack in the bike basket and my phone slid down and fell landed face down on asphalt and got some nasty cracks on its screen protector</p></li>

</figure>
<p>I continue ride. When i have maybe like half or 40% left, i started wondering if i had enough time to finish, and then i started biking harder and take less break. It was then a continual cycle of how many km/h i need to bike at to finish the trip in a timely manner and guessing how many km/h i am currently biking at because bike had no speedometer.</p>
<p>It seemed like i would finish in time i think. at least based on the road signs indication of how many km left. but i kept pushing myself in case i ran into some trouble. and also the place i have to return my bike to, idk how long it will take me to get there from the end of the course.</p>
<p>Toward the end i am still going on time but slightly nervous because if i mess something up i may not make it return bike in time i think. I bike as consistently as possible, following the recommended marked path because even though maybe i can maybe theorize a faster path, i dont want to accidentally mess up end up wasting even more time. Despite the electric assist of bike it is still a bit quite tiring pedaling for this long.</p>
<p>When i am approach an important last part of the journey i look at google maps more closely and realize the thing that looked like it was just bike across a little bridge or sth is.. a ferry.</p>
<p>I must return bicycle at palce at 7:00 and it is now 6:45. I am stopped at an intersection thing wondering to cross the street or turn left go in the direction of ferry. How often does ferry come? If i bike around take a bridge instead of take ferry directly will i possibly arrive faster?</p>
<p>There was a sign saying something like to take the ferry. So, I biked over to the ferry area. I stared at some schedule not really know what is happening, and then i notice some people walking over to im guessing ferry that is arriving. So i follow them. and i get on some boat with the other people, follow the pattern of other people that have bicycle, which is walk it over to the center. The boat soon departs. Someone comes around and it looks like people are handing him money. so when he comes over i give him the posted fare amount of money. I ride the short ferry ride, and it arrives where i am supposed to go, which was a large relief.</p>
<p>Get off the boat i hurry over looking for the bike return place it is almost time up. Something said it was in a parking area so i was looking around the parking area. Some old guy who gave off a grumpy vibe did or said sth to indicate that rental bicycle return is probably over there. I go over there and he did something like take the bike from me and indicate go over there with ur receipt or something. I went over there handed over my receipt and person wrote down some number from the receipt i think and said ok ur good to go (approx), and so i left.</p>
<p>Slightly stressed and shooked by the rushed ending of bike journey, i find my way to the onomichi JR train station. There is a seven eleven, and so i enter the seven eleven and look around. I buy a stick <ruby>churrokki<rt>チュロッキー</rt></ruby> (pack of 4) and a 1L bottle of water. i also used the station bathroom then sit in some station waiting area and eat my Churokkis (i think its supposed to be hybrid between churro and cookie. it tasted like doughnut also.) and stuff.</p>

<p>The train is soon to come, and so i beep through the gates. I ride the train towards “Mihara” where i plan to stay for the night. but actually this train only goes to “Itozaki” station which is slightly not reaching “Mihara” station. But “itozaki” station looks close enough to where im going to go so i just get off itozaki station dont bother transferring to the train going further.</p>
<p>It is now sunsetting/sunsetted already time, and i walk through the early evening air. Has a vibe of about average medium/small japanese city it feels like. i see the aeon mall in the distance.</p>

<p>I walk over towards the (Kaikatsu) Club which im planning on staying tonight. There is also a nearby mcdonalds so im thinking for dinner i get some mcdonalds eat it in the club. So i pass by the Kaikatsu and walk shortly over a bridge to reach the mcdonalds.</p>
<p>But when i reach the mcdonalds it is in a little area with other restaurants as well. so i think: maybe i eat something else. The other options was some kind of looks like chain ramen store or chain teishoku store. i liked teishoku more both in terms of food and vibes i think so i go in there, called “yayoiken”. And to my pleasant(?) surprise it is simply order on the digital kiosk thing get a ticket wow..</p>
<p>And so i got my ticket enter the store. The person who notice me as i enter may have asked me “you are one person?”. and they may have said something like “sit where you want”. Or they may have mentioned something about counter seat but i forget. i didnt seat at counter seat though. I sat at non-counter seat, and they take my ticket and rip it and put half of it in the plastic tube stand thingy and say sth like “tea and water is self serve” and leave.</p>
<p>And so i sit doing idk probably staring off or look at phone until person came back with food and said something like the rice refills is self serve. and leave. oh yeah i forgot to mention they had a rice refill machine. like a water dispenser but it just dispensed white rice. into your bowl. wow.</p>
<p>I eat my food which was the limited time promoted meal i think, which was the grilled cow galbi and hormone set (i switched a large multicolored rice). i think hormone is uh some of the intestine bits idk which ones. but anyways it was yummy. maybe i should have gotten the double portion i think that would have been even more yummy but oh well.</p>

<p>I finished and leave (there did not seem to be a tray return) and walk back to the kaikatsu club which had a self kiosk, so i self kiosked myself in. I take a shower and dry myself with a free (for use) towel, and do a small load of laundry and stuff. The room i picked was labeled as “gaming” room or something i think, and the pc in it did look like gamer. i opened the steam and signed into my steam account for first time in long time and none of the games i own were installed it seemed and i didnt really want to play game anyway so i just didnt gamer that night.</p>
<section id="this-kaikatsu-club-shower-rooms" class="aside">
<h2>this kaikatsu club shower rooms</h2>
<p>most kaikatsu club i been to usually has a “sink + shower room” for each gender i believe. The shower room is one big room that has a few sinks for drying ur hair and i think brush teeth and shave and stuff, and the showers are in small lockable booths attached to that bigger room, each booth has like the lowered shoe take off zone, a basket for u put stuff in, a foam bath-mat thing, and the actual shower itself.</p>
<p>This kaikatsu club, and i am guessing others, had a configuration such that i think showers were no gender specified and each shower was its own lockable room with the shoe elevation area, a little shelf area with towels, a sink + hairdryer, and the shower itself. So like a whole little personal room with sink and shower.</p>
</section>
<p>But i did finally tried out to read manga because it has manga. I picked out a few volume of a series that i know exists and then bring them to room and read like ten pages total or something which i kind of already have seen because they were in the anime i remember. i was kind of tired. and so ended my manga reading experience.</p>
<p>i brushed teeth and stuff and went to sleep.</p>
