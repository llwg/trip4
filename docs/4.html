<p>Yeah today i woke up in the hotel. It’s time to go! So, I went. I went to the train station, and i go to take a train to hakata. And then, i take a train to fukuoka airport (FUK).</p>
<p>At the airport i believe i check in with my airline (jeju air) at the people counter. Interestingly, they did not ask for any proof of onward flight or nothing. Then, I go to security.</p>
<p>After security i buy masks and a vitamin juice. I thought about buying a meal, but either nothing looked appetizing enough to order it or i was worried i would miss flight or i would rather eat after flight or some combination of all of these. So i did not eat a meal. I drank my juice.</p>
<p>I board the plane to South Korea Busan Gimhae Airport, and the flight flies me there.</p>

<p>In Busan, I plan to meet someone I chatted with on a language exchange app and they told me yesterday where i need to go so I will go there. After arrival, I exit, and stop by an ATM where i withdraw some Korea Money. Then, I go to the train.</p>

<h2>get the immigration and customs card on the plane</h2>
<p>On the plane the cabin attendants was handing sth that looked like immigration, customs cards. i need that.. i have learned the convenience of filling it out on the plane instead of at the airport. so, i held up my hand in the pls give me one pose, and the person give me one. They also asked me sth i didnt understand and i looked kind of confused. then idk if they just repeated, but i think they asked, in japanese, if the person sitting at the window was with me (and i guess if they needed a card as well). i denied this and they leave.</p>
<p>So i got the immigration card this way, but i still did not have customs form. so i posed for a different cabin attendant for the customs form, but they gave me the same immigration card. i tried communicate i want the customs card, there was some kind of communication error but somehow i did get the customs card, but the cabin attendant from before came over as well and then explained something in japanese like i dont need the customs card if (????(idk)). i assume it means sth like u only need customs card if u have something to declare. so i say oh ok im daijoubu desu and they say daijoubu desuka? and i say yeah and they take the customs card back and said if i have a ballpen and i say yeah daijoubu desu and they leave. something like that. thanks.</p>

</figure>
<p>I take the train, transfer a train, and get off the train, walk into the street. There, i look at the street numbers to approximately navigate to an address given to me by the person im meeting. I successfully navigate to the place and enter the place, which is a cafe.</p>
<p>I enter the cafe and greet the person that is inside the cafe. The person looks confused, and i show them the profile of the language app person, and they was like oh they is uh coming. and then the person walked through the door, oh cool.</p>
<p>The person i was to meet was the cafe owner, and i believe the person i first greeted was they employee. They did some administrative stuff or something i think and then said ok lets go. But first i unloaded to them the america snacks i brought, and then we went, we walked over a street to a food place, which was not yet open. so we walked back to cafe and they gave me a free iced americano coffee.</p>
<p>We drank they coffee as waiting for restaurant, and somewhat talk about random stuff, and i borrowed a phone charger because i was quite low on battery.</p>
<p>It seems they was not very confident to speak english, and i was not very confident to speak korean, so the conversation was mainly they spoke in korean and i reply in english. But i think they said they prefer japanese over english so i kept that in mind try to also include some japanese in the mix.</p>
<p>It was eventually time to eat restaurant, so we walked to restaurant, entered, seated, and ordered noodle <ruby>물회<rt>mul hwoi</rt></ruby>. It was essentially cold tomato noodles i think. It was yummy though.</p>

<p>We returned to they cafe where i think they attempted and failed to call taxi with app, then succeeded we rode a taxi to a mountain, where there was a buddhist temple. We went into the buddhist temple and sat a bit. They told me about the different uh buddhas? big buddha statue? that were there. It was a nice architecture, as well as view out the architecture.</p>

<p>We exited that architecture and walked back down. When we was walking down the steps there was a worm in agony on the steps. i took a piece of grass or stick or something try to pick it up throw in the grass. my friend said: why dont u just use ur hands. oh ok that makes sense. but i think i did manage to pick the worm up and throw it in grass with the stick. but then i saw yet another worm in agony so i pick it up with my hand and throw it in the grass. it had been some in my life since i had touched a worm with my bare hand. And then as we continued descending the steps there was even more worms writhing in agony on the hot stone stairs, idrk what had made them come up. but i decided oh well and continued down the steps, leaving them to maybe find their way back to the dirt on their own (or die).</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs, we walked to a different architecture and walked into it and sat in it. In the different architecture we chatted about idrk what, i think one major theme was food and japan. Sometimes it was chat, and sometimes it was sat in a bit of silence, looking at the contents of the room. Or out the door at the scenery. At some point they pointed to i think a money box and say u can put money in there and wish/pray. i took out a KRW1000 bill and asked them what does one pray for. and they said idrk what. nothing came to mind for me to wish for so i sort of just stared at the box. i offered my 1000won bill to my friend bc idk what wish for and so they took it and put it in the thing and wished for idk what.</p>

<p>Some time, they say i need to go to bathroom so we left they went to bathroom and i went to bathroom as well and when i came out i photographed some butterflies and bug that was around the grounds. When they was out of the bathroom they went to some.. looks like information center or something? with sign that said “we have coffee” in the window and bought an iced coffees and gave me one and we walked down the mountain road.</p>

</figure>
<p>We walked down the mountain road, often continuing to chatting. We reached a larger road, walk along that, and then reached 낙동강 where we walked in the river park area stuff. Sometimes chatting, sometimes i pause to take a photo, etc., a peaceful walk.</p>

<p>I believe they plan was to walk back completely to cafe area, but they said the time may not be good for me to make my returning ferry at around 6:30pm, so they ordered a taxi and we ride it back to the area, where we entered a restaurant to eat evening meal.</p>
<p>There was nobody in the restaurant except the <ruby>harmony<rt>older woman</rt></ruby> who i assume operating it. Friend say approx: can we eat rn, and the response was probably approx: yeah. So we take off the shoes enter, sit at table, they ordered an <ruby>아구찜<rt>agu jjim</rt></ruby>, and also a soda pop.</p>
<p>We sip on a soda pop from the two provided glasses in mostly silence. they was using phone. i looked over at the tv which i believe was broadcasting some trot idol programme or so. but then it became a very long infomercial for a <ruby>3초<rt>three second</rt></ruby> <ruby>전동<rt>electric</rt></ruby> <ruby>칼갈이<rt>knife sharpener</rt></ruby>. There was also another party that entered, i believe shortly before the 3초 전동 칼갈이 infomercial started.</p>
<p>The 아구찜 arrive, it was nice. My first time eating it. It was like a fish, roughly cut, braised in a <ruby>된장<rt>doin jang</rt></ruby> and bean sprouts and chilis type deal. Yum!</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In a short time i ran out of rice so i ask friend if i can get another and they asked for me the rice, and the rice come. I think this is when the harmony say sth and i didnt know what she said and friend i think said that she said that the bones (parts) are tasty.</p>
<p>So i did my best sucking all the stuff off the bones. There was many tasty gelatinous bits which was yummy.</p>
<p>Friend finished eating but there was quite a bit left so i did my best finish, ate a third bowl of rice. tbh i felt a bit awkward take so long to eat and use that many extra bowl of rice, but friend reported that harmony apparently regarded this as good/liked that i ate so much, which was nice.</p>
<p>After the meal the friend walk me to the station and say good bye, and i took the train to the Busan Station, where i can walk to the ferry port. Walking up the stairs out of the train station i tripped on the stairs with my camera hanging in front of me. i broke my fall with my hands. i heard some part of the camera making contact with the ground. oh no!!!!!. Luckily, the part that made contact with the ground seemed to just be the lens hood which suffered only a minor scuff, and the lens and camera seemed to be fine.</p>

</figure>
<p>I walk to the ferry port thing, taking pictures along the way. I find the ferry line counter. I try to say sth to the person. they reply something like english “Passport Please”. I gave them my passport, and they gave me my ticket and a customs and immigration card.</p>
<p>I fill out the customs and immigration card and go to go through security or something. Theres a customs counter or sth before security which i was sort of confused. I went over and maybe showed my customs card, and the person explained (in english i think) something like the immigration and customs cards were japanese ones that u use to get through japanese immigrations and customs (i dont think u need to go through IMMIGRATION&amp;CUSTOMS when ur leaving a country?).</p>
<p>So i go through the security checkpoint. basically just airport security. And then im waiting in the waiting area to board the boat.</p>
<p>Wait for idrk how long, it felt kinda long. Eventually, board the boat.</p>
<p>i was tired, walking up to my room when i saw a sign for a big bath. wow i love a big bath! So, i think: let me drop my stuff off in the room real quick, then i go to the big bath ASAP so i can use when the bath water is still fresh etc.</p>
<p>So i go to my room. I have the lowest class room, which is essentially just a floor you lay the pad out and sleep with a bunch of people side by side. I was going to pick spot next to the window, but a guy dressed like cowboy or something was about to pick it as well so i just yielded it to them, pick the spot two spots over.</p>
<p>I went and speed run the washing in the big bath. i wondered if they had a towel rental so i wouldnt have to use my own. but i didnt really want to ask so i just used my own.</p>
<p>I return to the room after washed. There was only one outlet (two plug acceptors) in entire room it seem. So i charge my phone from that outlet a bit. There is no wifi also btw. And also i walked outside on deck a little i think take a pic or two.</p>

<p>I go to sleep early ish, some time shortly after 9pm i think. Nobody else really in the room when i go to sleep i believe. I cover my eyes with my wet towel and put in ear plugs and drift to sleep.</p>
