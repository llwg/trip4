<p>I woke up in the club and checked out at 10:14 am. On my way westward to Mihara station i stopped by Yayoiken again to have a morning meal. This time i got to use the rice refill machine which was cool. The meal also came with a single shrimp tempura which i am slightly allergic so i was planning not to eat but after eat half, the allergic sensations seemed bearable so i ate the other half.</p>

</figure>
<p>Walking to the station before or after meal, I also realized that i no longer had my hat. i usually do not wear hats, but this trip i had deciden to bring one for keeping sun out of eyes. so i brought a baseball cap that i got in university for free, it was quite a nice baseball cap, and so when i realized i had lost it, it was sort of sad moment.</p>
<p>I had no clue where i lost it. Maybe left it in the club. maybe left it at yayoiken. in the train. in the bike basket. on the ferry. i had no clue. and i accept the transience of life and things, and so i walk on.</p>

<p>I was looking up how to get to my next destination which is like 3 train stops over. Google maps says there is a bus i can take that is the fastest route. So i went to bus stop wait for the bus.</p>
<p>The bus comes like 9 mins late, google maps says i will arrive at 11:50, need to walk over to the ferry terminal take the ferry which departs at 12:00. Sounds a little tough especially because i need to buy tickets before actually getting on ferry. But i hope that the bus catches up its schedule a bit maybe so i will get more time.</p>
<p>The bus does not seem to catch up its schedule and actually maybe becomes even later because people start getting off at seemingly almost every single stop, oops!, so i remember when i arrive at the desired bus stop it was quite close to 12:00.</p>
<p>I kind of really want to take the 12:00 ferry because the next one was i think 2:15pm. So when i get off bus I ran over to the harbor thingy, entered the building. i spotted ticket machine. i bought a ticket as fast as possible. take my change and tickets. hurriedly exited out the front. ran over to what looks like the ferry. I present my tickets to someone and they take a ticket from my sheet of two (i purchased round-trip from the vending machine). I am boarded on the ferry. the ferry soon departs. Phew!</p>

<p>It was a short ferry ride arrive at “Okunoshima”. I became know about this place from some instagram reel once say it has bunnies. Got off the ferry, yes there was bunnies. Bunny around. Bunny eating lettuce someone gave it in front of restroom. etc.</p>

<p>I go to walk across island some. it is not very big island, like 25 min walk across whole thing. I walked and saw, take pictures of the bunnies which freely roam and i believe are feral. They will often run up to you quite quickly i think want you give them food. But unfortunately i brought none food. I walk on. I walk and see a little beach, dip my feet into sea. Walk up some hill forest thing.</p>

<p>I was already become sort of physically exhausted at this point. i stop at a gazebo at top of mountain hilly thing and sat for a little. Sort of ready to walk back to harbor/pier and take next ferry back. But one thing i do want to visit is the poison gas museum. Yes the WWII poison gas museum in middle of bunny island. Ookunoshima used to be poison gas manufacturing place in WWII they say. so i will go to the museum.</p>
<p>I walk down the hill, over to the museum. There was some entry fee.. but i decide to go in anyway because when else will i visit the japanese wwii poison gas museum in middle of bunny island. So i put my coins in the vending machine, bought the ticket, handed the ticket to the attentant person. they gave me a little information pamphlet thing and i went inside the left room.</p>

<p>The left room was a museum room various poison gas related artifacts like i think gas masks and manufacturing equipment and stuff and some other stuff. it said no photography so i didnt photography. the signs describe stuff like uh i think how workers who were probably disproportionately korean and chinese became ill after making the gas and horrors of war and etc</p>
<p>I went over to right area and right area was some kind of lecture hall or sth it seemed and also had pretty spooky pictures of what happens to human body when exposed to poison gas. in the halls had some strings of paper cranes and looks like what i assume some school children make some pictures like “peace! no war!”, etc type drawn pictures.</p>
<p>I exited the poison gas museum. There was ferry coming sort of soon i think. so i could go walk back over east to pier/harbor take the ferry exit island. But i see on google maps that to the north there is “toxic gas storage site” which looks interesting. So i walk over there north. Pass by some run-down-ish looking tennis courts look like they might fit into post-apocalyptic game type vibe. I walk along the edge of the woods where some signs said there was some sort of ruins but i didnt really see any. but i did meet some more rabbits roaming around.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8299.webp" id="DSCF8299" alt="" /><figcaption>7.4 13:39 Walking across large flat areas there was often these depressions in the ground. i thought, maybe they are related to bunnies. however idk because idk much about bunny.</figcaption>

<p>I reached the toxic gas storage ruins site which is sort of cut into the side of the hill. yes it does like ruins. and it has rope in front of it saying dont go in (“No admittance”). so i looked, took a picture, and walked on.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8338.webp" id="DSCF8338" alt="" /><figcaption>7.4 14:07 ruins</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I walk more north and around, see some other ww2-related ruins. And then there was a sign saying there is some observation deck type deal this way, so i went that way. It was quite uphill and i was both hot and exhausted but i kept going. i passed by “Japan’s Tallest Metal Transmission Tower”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8347.webp" id="DSCF8347" alt="" /><figcaption>7.4 14:24 This might have been the transmission tower i think. or maybe it wasnt. idrk what a transmission tower is actually.</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>I finally reached some kind of wooden observation deck. the view i do not remember being particularly impressive. i think it was a bit foggy or something. or maybe sun was in eyes i couldnt see anything. or something. There was typical stuff that is at an observation deck like those things that are like binoculars built into some rotating metal structure. A metal compasslike thing or maybe a sundial i forget. Some sunbleached (i think) map on the floor.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8374.webp" id="DSCF8374" alt="" /><figcaption>7.4 14:42 Reach the deck. Maybe this was the transmission tower. it doesnt seem too tall though.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was tired and so i walk down, pretty done ready to leave. i walk back down to the pier. While waiting for boat back, i bought and tried Qoo Orange drink. At some time i think there was announcement about boats idrk. So i went over to pier. There was a line of people looked like they must be going back to mainland so i wait in line. some people behind me was talking sth about huh is that ferry that is coming and going the one go back to mainland? what boat we waiting for? etc., and said sth like a lot of foreign tourists here, which made me feel perceived and self conscious.</p>

<p>Eventually the line move, we board a smallish boat back which was pink i think. Boat goes back to mainland. Get off. And so ended my trip to Okunoshima.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8428.webp" id="DSCF8428" alt="" /><figcaption>7.4 15:37 On the boat</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I used bathroom at the little tourist area thing and looked at the souveniers at the shop and then walked over to the JR station Tadanoumi. I beep my card and walk through to the platform, wait for train.</p>
<p>Standing there on the platform waiting when i heard some male students talking about something that i have no clue what they actually was talking about but some kind of words i heard and maybe that self consciousness i felt in line earlier waiting for boat i think triggered some kind of paranoia and it feels like they are talking shit about me even though i dont even remember what words i understood that made me think that.</p>
<p>Eventually the train come and i board. i sit on the right hand side of train. But actually left hand side is cooler because it is facing the sea. There is an empty seat (pair) open on the left, but it has a whole bag of spilled mcdonalds, fries spilled on the floor underneath the seat in front of it, and so to sit in that seat i would take responsibility of that mcdonalds. Maybe i could have just cleaned it up sat there.. But i just waited a bit longer i think train pretty emptier, i got up and wandered back through train, found a left-side seat and sat there.</p>
<p>It was about a one hour 15 minute train ride in total i think from Tadanoumi to Hiro station. Google maps says i need to arrive at Hiro at 17:26, transfer to train departing at 17:27 towards Hiroshima. i dont even know how that works if even one train is off schedule. Or if idk the platform. or etc. so that was sort of stressful thinking about how im going to make that transfer. But i am guessing that a lot of other people would have to make that transfer, so i supposed that i would figure the transfer out when i get there.</p>
<p>I dozed off on the train. Awoke. The train arrive at final stop, Hiro station. the doors open. many people including me exiting the train. I follow the flow of people, and also see that the platform across from this one has a departure listed on the electronic board for 17:27 so i assume thats where i need to go, and everyone is going.</p>
<p>I follow people up the stairs across the track bridge thingy, back down to the platform in front of station. Yes, people seem to be lining up for this 17:27 train. so i go line up also. There was some announcement in japanese i made out to be something like the 17:27 train is late sorry. I stood there waiting at very end of platform in a little corner not quite standing in actual line but standing near a line so i could join a line once train come. I stood around and look around and took a pic or two in my little corner. Some time a train or two came or went on the platform across. At these times the announcer guy came on the announcement and sayed something like Hello people that are waiting for the late 17:27 train. that is not ur train. please wait for ur train.</p>

<p>The train eventually came some tens of minutes later. I board the train along with everyone else and ride until it reaches Hiroshima, where i get off. On that train, or train before that brought me to Hiro, i looked up local chain food places, and “Chikara Udon” show up, and there was a Chikara Udon in hiroshima station. So i think to go try that udon.</p>
<p>So i walk around hiroshima station trying to go find that chikara udon. It was another of those japanese large stations where there are many exits that get mixed in with department stores and shopping and food places and stuff. so i wander around for a while before finally finding some place with a floor map and i found chikara udon on that floor map and walked over.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8460.webp" id="DSCF8460" alt="" /><figcaption>7.4 18:48 View outside</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shop was not very busy. I look at the shop. The menu posted looks a bit different than the menu i saw on google maps reviews. I walk a little past the shop see it from different angle. There is another menu posted that looks more like the menu i saw on google maps. There was also a different counter from the one i initially passed by. There was nobody attending either of the counters.</p>
<p>Let me draw a diagram of what it was like</p>
<pre><code>chikara |O  O|
   udon |O   |   O represents a seat
        |O  O|
kitchen |O   / [MENU Y]
        |[B]
---[A]-----/
 [MENU X]

--- way i walk ---&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>so as you can see i first walk by counter A indicated by <code>[A]</code>. then circle around look at menu Y. while i was staring at menu Y becoming anxiety. someone walked up and order something at counter B (<code>[B]</code>). and then someone else walked up order something at counter A. oh ok so maybe i can order something too.</p>
<p>So i commit my order to memory the best i can and then hover over to counter A which seems to be done taking an order. but the person said something like like “this is the takeout rice ball order counter. if u want to order other food eat in restaurant pls order at the other counter.”. I dont actually know if thats what they said but taking all things into account, that is what the message seemed to be. So i wait at counter B for other person to finished being processed.</p>
<p>And it became my turn to order and think i struggled to know if they was ready to take my order. and then i struggled to say my order. i think i said the udon order correctly but then ordering the rice ball i forgot what rice ball or what a rice ball is or something and i repeatedly stuttered sth like “<ruby>tto..tto..tto…<rt>っと..っと..っと...</rt></ruby>” which i dont even know what i meant by that. と? あと? meaningless filler sound? not sure.</p>
<p>but somehow i got the order across correctly and so i sat at the counter recovering. the person brought over my rice ball thank you. and udon person put udon on the shelf thing on counter for me to take when it was done.</p>
<p>And so i eat my meat udon and rice ball, which was tasty. in some google review i think i remember saying sth like the chikara udon taste is slightly acidic. i think i did taste that. it was quite good. i liked it more than typical udon broths i think.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I finished eating and hopped off my counter stool and left, go to find my way to my hotel for the night.</p>
<p>As i am navigating the many station exits, i saw an entrance to a bic camera. i kind of wanted to look at cameras again. so i went in and looked at cameras. and when i was exiting, I think this was the place where there was some claw machines. And i didnt actually want any of the things but they looked kind of fun like “hmm if i do this, maybe i would win it”. so i wasted a few hundred yen discovering that if i did that, i would not win it. and i left continue towards hotel.</p>
<p>I wanted more food to eat in hotel for some reason. i guess udon was not enough. so i decide maybe i stop by mcdonalds. so i navigate to the mcdonalds. it was top level of this very large department store type building. i take the elevator up and greeted with ronald mcdonald sitting on a bench. apparently this is the highest elevation mcdonalds in japan, it said.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF8465.webp" id="DSCF8465" alt="" /><figcaption>7.4 20:01 donald</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So i walk past the mcdonalds. A quite small storefront. Unfortunately it did not have a self kiosk. and i was not in the condition to order verbally. So i continued walking past. i tried to look casual walking past the mcdonalds but i think i heard one of the employees saying “oh i thought they were gonna order” or something. but since i dont actually know japanese that might have just been a hallucination.</p>
<p>I walked down the hallway past some other restaurants or store and then walked back past the mcdonalds the other way, arrive back at the elevator, take it back down. Two female student was also riding that elevator and one was reading some english on a sign with a funny exaggerated accent.</p>
<p>At the bottom floor i think i turned the wrong way or something and accidentally walking into the department store which was closing. Someone said to me uhh sorry bro we are closing! and i agreed and said oop! internally and turned back and turned the correct way out into the streets.</p>
<p>The streets was nighttime and random construction project and lots of tall buildings. The tall buildings sort of obscured all visible landmarks and street views so i had no clue where i was actually facing and where im supposed to walk towards my hotel.</p>
<p>I tried looking at the google maps and mapping out where each of the toyoko inn, apa hotels etc (which i could see from where i was standing) was on the map so i could figure out where i was facing. i think i figured something out, pick a direction and walk it.</p>
<p>I arrived shortly at the hotel whose first floor was a Matsuya with a special silver logo, i think to match the hotel. Interesting. And the front desk is on the second floor. interesting. For some reason i dont remember anything about this checkin, but i do remember i believe the room keycard was coated in bamboo or something. fancy hotel vibe.</p>
<p>I drop my stuff in my room and go back down, intend to eat at the matsuya. And i entered the matsuya via the direct entrance connection from the hotel first floor and went over to the good old familiar matsuya digital kiosk. But nothing seemed very appetizing. So i exited to the streets.</p>
<p>I walk and look at phone google maps, what other food is there?. And on the map i saw a yayoiken. wow. third time yayoiken? ok. so i went there, eat a chicken namban meal, one hour thirty minutes after i ate the udon.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I finish and exit to the street again. And i decide to go to convenience store get a drink and snack to eat in the hotel room. yes i guess the meal was not enough. bought a snack, an alcohol free beer, an alcohol sweet apple cider, another 1L water, and a vegetable juice.</p>
