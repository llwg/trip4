<p>i woke up in the morning. i could hear the fellow guests around and about, hearing the <ruby>ohio gozaimasus<rt>good morning</rt></ruby>.</p>
<p>i rinsed my face and stuff at the public sink area which had i think rooster faucet knob. I do not know if it was this morning i noticed or last night, but beside the sink area also had some sort of table which had a variety of world currencies underneath the glass top. one of the japanese woman said ohio gozaimas to me at the sink, and i made an effort to return the greeting.</p>
<p>im tidy up room and gather belongings. i noticed i didnt hang up my towel i used yesterday and it is still quite moist and slightly smells not great. oops!. i hang it up. there is also a bit of sandy bits on the floor which is not great. i try to pick some of it up with a leftover dried up wet wipe. uh not great sand picking upper but i think there was not too much sand so oh well i guess.</p>
<p>with my stuff i leave my room to check out. i think i ask guy that sat to my left yesterday who seemed like helper concerning check out and then he went and found owner guy. owner i think calculate some stuff and tell me the money i owe which was 3300 yen, broken down as 2500 for bbq fee, 400+200+200 for drinks at the bbq. i probably hand over three 1000yen bills and then i believe on the counter i lay out probably two 100yen coins and then pull out ten 10-yen coins bc i had a lot, line them up neatly presented. the guy confirms and walks out with me i think. i think this is when he asks like “where u going next”. or maybe it was before payment i dont really remember. i said osaka. he probably sayed sth like “oh!”.</p>
<p>i unlock bike, bring it to the road in preparation to ride it. i think the guy say good bye greetings. i dont really remember what was said. i think it might have mostly been in japanese. i recall he might have said “take care”. also, i think guy that sat to my (direct?) right yesterday at the bbq was also there.</p>
<p>i ride my bike. i look back, they are waving. i wave back. i ride more down the street and look back, and they still watch, they wave. i raise my arm as a sort of wave trying not to lose balance on bike as my final good-bye. i ride on.</p>
<p>I cross the kurima bridge again the other way, stop a little and look off the little observation hump they have on bridges. continue ride.</p>
<p>ride back where i came from. along same path next to where i slipped on mud yesterday. ride into town. ride over to food establishment that i saw on google maps seems serve a breakfast. park bike on side of street and walk in.</p>

</figure>
<p>i sit at a counter seat. there are menus on the counter. i look at the menu. i think when restaurant person is out and about doing stuff, i nonverbally engage them by like holding hand up looking like i want to order. i order the breakfast meal. and the “mango”. they say something, i dont remember if they have to repeat it before i understood it or ive just been through this type of thing enough that i now understand when i missed an option. i think they also pointed to the part of the menu that shows the options. i can choose either karaage or something i didnt know how to read. so i picked the karaage. and they said ok. and i followed up with “and the mango” and they said e.g. yeah the mango</p>
<section id="the-mango" class="aside">
<h2>the mango</h2>
<p>under the drink section there was drinks such as “cola”, “oolong tea”, and “milk”, but also simply “apple”, “pine”, and “mango”. i assumed that these were juices. but “juice” was not written after them. so i just ordered it as “mango”.</p>
</section>
<p>They first gave me the mango juice which had ice. i drank the mango juice within some tens of seconds. i was quite thirsty. i then sat and looked at phone while occasionally drinking through the straw the melted ice and mango juice remnants. Shop workers were I only ever saw that one guy who took my order and who was preparing the food it looks like. I saw them using the microwave. and maybe using blender?. behind the counter. Maybe running shop alone.</p>
<p>the breakfast meal was some time served and i ate the breakfast meal. i payed and leaved.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20250628_094926.webp" id="20250628_094926" alt="" /><figcaption>6.28 9:49 Food. the taste was not particularly fantastic or terrible as i remember. probably not in top 10 foods i ate on this trip though.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>i leave on the bike but shortly see a vending machine and so i buy a large can of sanpin tea which seems to be okinawa jasmine tea and i drink that because i am still thirsty. i continue on bike.</p>
<p>i ride over to bike rental place to return the bike. from looking at the paperwork that they gave me, i learned that “to return” is probably “henkyaku” in japanese. so when i parked my bike and walk into the store i say “henkyaku shimasu” and show paperwork/hand over key to bike. the guy says oh ok! and does sth like match key or paperwork to records or sth and says ok thx bye! and i leave.</p>
<p>i visit the nearby grocery store that i bought the snack pine from yesterday. i think mainly because i still have some time before i have to take bus to airport. i wander around. at the refrigerated drink area, i pick out this electrolyte drink with interesting name i think ive seen before but never tried called GREEN DA・KA・RA, and “guava tea”.</p>
<p>walking over to check out, i notice there is self register i didnt see yesterday, so i go do that.</p>
<p>the self register kiosk prompts me pick a bag option. One option is plastic bag. no i only have two drinks i dont need one. Another option is “My Bag”. i believe this means you brought your own grocery bag. um ok i choose that. it tells me to put bag in the bagging area. oh.. is it gonna weigh it or sth?.. i dont have an actual bag except like my backpack.. i click back and study options again. i cant remember if there was a third option. maybe there was and i couldnt fully read, understand it. i click around. i think i end up selecting My Bag and then just click OK or whatever after it says put ur bag in bagging area without putting nothing there.</p>
<p>and so i scan my green DA・KA・RA and put it in bagging area. i think it complains pls put ur thing in bagging area. the kiosk has some error. an employee comes over and taps kiosk and stuff says mmhmm oh ok yeah u got it in there resolves error somehow. i scan my other thing and pay with cash. as i walk out the store, the/an employee sticks some paid-indicator tape on one of my bottles.</p>
<p>i sit outside on the same concrete cube seat thing i sat on yesterday. drank some of the electrolyte drink. tastes like electrolyte sports drink.</p>
<p>i think to go over to the nearby “blue seal” ice cream which is opening in a few minutes. i hear it is okinawa ice cream chain. i walk over and look at the menu display in window. There are too many options. too many flavors. it is intimidating. and i dont really like ice cream anyway. so i walk away.</p>
<p>then i think i walked into various ATM booths along the street to try to withdraw cash because i have heard that okinawa has ATMs that let you withdraw 2000-yen bills which are rare. but those ATMs was not so. or my card didnt work. or some combination.</p>
<p>wandered around. might have gone into yesterday’s clothes store again also. eventually wandered back to blue seal and decided to get the thing that was at the very top left, first thing on menu, called soft salt milk.</p>
<p>i walked in. there was a person. i walk up to counter engage nonverbally. i say e.g. one soft salt milk pls. i think they responded “what do u want it in?”, and i probably sayed e.g. “uhhhh” and i think they say something explaining different containers. im guessing i pointed to something on the counter and said this one pls. or maybe i actually tried to say the name. dont really remember. and so they said ok and i paid with my 500 yen coin. or maybe they made it first. i kind of forget. but i do remember when i was taking the ice cream from them i took it in such a way that the bottom paper cone holder thingy fell off onto the counter.</p>
<p>i take my cone and sit in a chair and try it. it tastes like ice cream i think. after taste more, i get out of chair and walk out of store, eat it as i walk.</p>
<p>walk over to bus stop. there is a bus stop closer by that google maps says i could take to the airport. but i dont see that bus stop listed on bus company’s website thing so i do not trust google maps. I stand at the bus stop i was standing at. around expected bus arrival time, a bus approaches, looks like it is pulling up. looking at the markings at the bus, it is not my bus. so i e.g. shake head, nonverbally indicate this is not my bus i am not getting on. the bus did not stop, drove on.</p>
<p>A while later the bus i needed came and i get on. i think the driver asked me if im paying in (credit?) card or cash and i said cash and he handed me a ticket, which was piece of paper with stop i got on at circled. i sit and ride bus.</p>
<p>I remember the bus drove by some interesting looking harbor area. i remember kind of wishing i had walked over there look around instead of just walk around that small shopping area.</p>
<p>Bus make one or a few stop, some but not many people got on after me. not many people on the bus overall. the bus arrives at airport, and person carrying a money box comes on bus to process payments. i think they was having some trouble or so with credit card machine thing. i showed my ticket and payed my 600 yen in coin and got off bus.</p>
<p>i check in at the self kiosk and clean out my bag a bit get rid of old receipts, use bathroom, briefly browse the souvenier shops. then i go through to the single security check. when i was looking at the signs of stuff they say cannot bring on flight, i saw one saying no liquids on international flights. which sort of scared me because even though im domestic flights (which im pretty sure allow liquid). It seemed that that security check was combined international and domestic. i didnt know how they differentiate between international and domestic flight people. and if they are going to give me more dialogue concerning my liquids. so i exited line and then finish drank one of my two bottles of liquid and recycled the bottle. maybe 1 instead of 2 would cause less trouble. not really sure. i re-entered security.</p>
<section id="theory-on-why-dont-need-to-differentiate-between-international-and-domestic-flight-people-in-this-context" class="aside">
<h2>theory on why dont need to differentiate between international and domestic flight people in this context</h2>
<p>heres my theory why actually the airport does not need to differentiate at this security check point.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>there is not many international flights so probably only a few times a day where are processing both international and domestic flights at the same time</p></li>
<li><p>i saw past this security point it seemed they had another security point for international flights (which was closed at the time, guessing bc no international flights at the time)</p>
<ul>
<li>so if you had international flight i guess you would need to go through two security check?.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>the security person was holding a laminated information sheet of things should not have and asking people if you got any of them. i figured that they would be stuff like weapon, knife, etc., but i saw the guy in front pointing at something on the sign and said, “oh i got drinks” before getting let through. Oh the sign does list Drinks on the List of Things. so i learned from this and did the same, indicated i got drinks. and got let through as well. My pet bottle of drink went through scanner. And then the scanning person might have asked me can i scan ur drink and put it in that liquid scanner thing and i said ok. or might have not done that, not sure. some security checks seem to ask before scanning ur drink. some security checks seem to dont ask u before scan ur drink. some security checks dont seem to scan drink separately with liquid scanner thing at all.</p>
<p>i exit the security check which was one building and walk over to the terminal which was another building. i couldnt tell where the entrance was so i inadvertently walked to the left of the building where it looks like there is some place that is usually filled with water but not currently filled with water. or maybe it actually was filled with water but it just felt so hot and concrete that it didnt feel like any presence of water.</p>
<p>there was a couple taking pictures at this area and i nonverbally asked if they want me to take they pics by like pointing to they phone and miming taking pictures. they said oh ok thanks and so i took they phone and put my guava tea bottle on the ground and took some pics of them. i take some candid pics of them while they setting up they pose and they was like oop! (the camera shutter sound effect was quite loud). and i took what seems like more than expected number of pics one would expect a random person takes ur pic for you. because in a little pause when readjusting angle i think they broke pose thinking it was done but no i kept taking pictures. it was a fun micro social experiment of some sort. when i finish and hand back the phone and pick up my guava tea, the guy says <ruby>torimasuka<rt>u want us to take pics of you</rt></ruby>? and i used negative body language and said <ruby>die joe boo desu<rt>nah im good</rt></ruby>, and leave.</p>
<p>i find entrance to the terminal building and enter. it has a souvenier shop and food place and restroom i think. look around. sit on a seat. listen to announcements.</p>

<p>boarding comes, time to board. have my boarding pass scanned, walk out into the backyard plane parking lot, board the plane. Plane flies to Naha.</p>
<p>Arrive in Naha, there is approx 3 hours before next flight. I was originally wanted to visit a prefectural public gym in this 3 hours. but after banging up my leg and elbow i think maybe not good time. so instead im thinking go do laundry and eat a food.</p>
<p>i picked a spot on map that has both a laundry and a food i want and i take bus instead of monorail over because google maps says maybe ill arrive like 3 mins faster. Arrive at the laundry, it only has those terrible combined wash+dry machines that for some reason cost 800 or 900 or idk yen. in my limited experience with these kinds of washer they are very Not Good compared to the cheaper and imo more sensible separate washer and drier. so i decide i will just not do my laundry here in naha. i leave to go eat food.</p>

<img src="media/DSCF6587.webp" id="DSCF6587" alt="" /><figcaption>6.28 15:49 Im at a shopping street</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I walk shortly over, through what looks like some shopping street(s). Arrive at the place i wanted to go to. It is a chain restaurant called 我部祖河食堂 whose main thing is that it is the originator of “soki soba” = i think essentially okinawa soba but main topping is soki (braised pork rib thing).</p>
<p>The shop looks slightly intimidating because there is no windows look inside so it looks like you just have to walk in blind not knowing what to expect. However it is less intimidating because it is covered large banners in multiple non-japanese languages and is also situated along shopping street, so it looks like it specifically caters to the foreign tourist such as myself. I walked up the little porch thing walk through the i believe wooden door. I was arrived at an off-hours i think, some time between 3 and 4. nobody in the shop except person that seems to be the operator who was sitting at counter watching phone, get up when i come into shop say a greeting, retreat to behind counter.</p>
<p>The order was a nice ticket machine, put in your cash and press the thing you want, get a ticket. I got the top-leftmost option, the so-ki soba. hand the ticket to the operator person, they maybe say something, disappear. i self-serve some water. look around. a small and wooden building. A small interior.</p>
<p>the person reappear with the assembled soki soba, i eat it. kind of tasted like every other okinawa soba ive had, except i noticed the pork did have some nice and yummy cartilage. i finish and there did not seem to be any obvious dish return area so i put tray on counter i think, person say thanks, i said thanks (to my best ability) and leave.</p>

</figure>
<p>across the street there is an area where many pigeons are hanging out. awesome!. i have not seen many places of many pigeons this trip so far. so i take this opportunity take out camera take some pics. After some time of take pics, it is already approx time to go to airport. so i go there, again check in, security, boarding.</p>

<p>On the plane i find my seat and sit down, and some time someone walk over says: are you 21C? (i am sitting in seat 21C). i look at my boarding pass and discover that i am not 21C, i am 16C. i sqeak out an oopsies sorry and walk ashamedly towards front of plane. which isnt great because there are people still boarding walking towards back of plane. but i think people cooperated, i reach 16C, i sit down. i checked my Miyakojima To Naha boarding pass and it was 21C, i guess that is why i got it confused.</p>
<p>Arrive at KIX. i wanted to fly to ITM airport instead because closer to destination and just to see a different airport. but tickets was probably cheaper or better time with KIX. So im at the KIX.</p>
<p>I decide take airport into the city bus because in my experience in japan the airport limousine buses are usually cheaper, faster, more convenient, and comfy seat than train. walk out the terminal following signs for bus. there is some airport bus ticket machine so i buy a ticket there. there is still some few mins before bus scheduled departure so run to bathroom use it real quick.</p>
<section id="that-terminal-area-was-quite-empty" class="aside">
<h2>that terminal area was quite empty</h2>
<p>not many people. and when i ran into the bathroom the automatic lights was turned off and my presence activated them.</p>
</section>
<p>board the bus, present my ticket. the bus driver took the whole thing from me while boarding which was unexpected. i think theres multiple different destination so when getting off idk how bus driver will know if i get off at correct one. maybe all the destinations were same fare so it doesnt matter idk. i took a seat. bus depart.</p>
<p>Bus drives through the night. on the bus i purchase a world expo ticket for tomorrow at 11am entry. i got off at umeda/osaka station. i find train to where im going and get on. i think it was crowded, because i recorded in notes at that time “as soon as get off airport bus shoving self into crowded train quite the experience.”, likely typing this into my phone while stood on the crowded train.</p>
<p>get off at nanba station i think walk over to “dotonbori”. the streets have lots of people smoking, smell like cigarettes. Walk over to “doutonbori kamukura ramen” which i learned from searching browsing “osaka local chain stores” online. now that i am looking, i think the store i visited in dotonbori was supposedly the first store. but i did not know this at the time. kind of just looked like any other random chain ramen store.</p>
<p>there was a digital ticket vending machine outside the shop. i remember there was looks like fellow foreign tourist looking at the machine next to me which gave me a bit of comfort. i buy ramen+gyoza+rice set ticket, go inside. kind of crowded and cramped, squeeze behind many people making my way through. Sit at the counter which goes around entire store around the cooking serving area thing. i sit at seat and hand ticket to worker who came over. they said sth i dont really remember what, i can only guess sth like “ok you got the [menu name]”.</p>
<p>i didnt know where to put bag so i put on seat next to me. And then i saw someone put they bag on hooks that are behind the seats on wall. i didnt notice those hooks existed. so i put my bag on one as well. the wall is covered is wall mirrors, maybe trying to make the cramped area feel bigger. which it did achieve, i think.</p>
<p>i think it is my first place at once of these kind of ramen place where you get a ticket and sit at a counter. the interior is modern and bright. looking forward into the kitchen island thing, there is a wrench lying between two machines. i take a picture of the wrench.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20250628_215640.webp" id="20250628_215640" alt="" /><figcaption>6.28 21:56 I was temporarily fixated on this wrench</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>after some time, worker come over and gives me the ramen and rice. i assumed gyoza would come later, and it did. im eating the ramen, cool. i actually do not really like ramen. it all kind of tasted the same to me. but this ramen tasted maybe slightly different, and it was pretty OK or good. it had lots of cabbage i think. there was also a jar of seasoned green onion greens on the counter. i add some to my soup and it tastes yummy.</p>

</figure>
<p>i finish my meal and hop off my stool take my bag leave, squeeze along the wall and stools through the one-way path out to the designated exit that i remember i heard workers many times say to ppl the exit is over there pls exit over there etc.</p>
<p>with my stomach full i walk up towards the dotonbori canal. most of the stuff i know about dotonbori like hanshin tiger fans diving into the canal and throwing kfc man into canal and glico runner sign i actually first came to know during a minorly traumatic event. so dotonbori and osaka in general kind of feel a little uncomfortable in mind, but i think finally visiting it reach a little resolution.</p>
<p>there was lots of neon signs and lots of people and stuff in the night time, neat to see. take some pictures. shortly walked over to the glico sign and took a picture. then navigate to my planned accomodation for the night, a kaikatsu club.</p>

</figure>
<p>i had looked up and picked this kaikatsu club earlier. i forget the exact criteria i based my decision on, but i think basically as cheap as other osaka kaikatsu club, had coin laundry and free shower. something like that. I arrived at it but then think: maybe i should buy band-aids. so i go into convenience store across the street, but they do not have band-aid brand bandaids. i kind of wanted band-aid brand. so i walk a few street over to different convenience store. i think they did have band-aid bandaids, but a different brand was cheaper/looked good or so, so i just got that different brand. and a 2L bottle of water.</p>
<p>walk back to the club and enter. They have a self register which i can now use because i have the membership card. wow!</p>
<p>I use the self kiosk register, sign in, my room key is QR code printed onto the receipt. cool! go to room, drop stuff off. go up to the shower rooms which is one floor up, walk up the spiral staircase. take a shower. then, do laundry. according to my receipt, i entered store at 10:58 pm, and my notes indicated i probably slept at or around 1:41 am. besides laundry and shower, i also used computer look/transfer some pictures from my camera. apply band-aids, brush teeth, fetch blankets, among other things.</p>
