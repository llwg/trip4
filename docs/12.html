<p>wake up early, exit hotel around 6 am, walk over to kochi station to catch the 6:31 train to susaki. many students was on that train, some had started to stand already when i was boarding. So i was going to stand as well. but i noticed that there was one of those 4x4 seat box arrangements with only 1 person in the corner. And i am riding whole length of route i dont really want to stand entire thing so i just sat in the other corner.</p>

<p>The train arrived at Susaki on time around 8:03, and i am scheduled catch bus at 8:33, so first i run to bathroom use bathroom, hurry over to bus stop confirm the bus stop location. i still have time before 8:33 so i decide scurry over to nearby lawson get some convenience food to eat now and later in day. i think i got a sandwich to eat now, two rice balls to eat later. Scurry back over to bus stop wait for bus.</p>

<p>bus arrive i get on. there was one other person ride bus, look like elderly woman. ride for long while. some stop, another elderly woman got on bus, greet everyone on the bus with an ohio gozaimas. continue riding through the shikoku mountainy road, scenery. infrequently pausing to let on or off elderly womans, only the sound of bus, the announcement thing announcing each of the 90 or so stops and saying stuff like <ruby>UNCHINHYOU<rt>the fare table</rt></ruby> GA <ruby>KAWARIMASHITA<rt>has changed</rt></ruby> (?) or sth. and occasional interaction between elderly woman and driver if they forgot/had trouble paying when get off bus.</p>
<p>My bus fare is over 1000 yen so i look up on my phone about if its ok to use paper bills in the bus fare box. and the internet said sth like probably OK but ask driver, suggest ask sth like “<ruby>kore koko de ii desu ka<rt>can i put this in here</rt></ruby>”. ok ill try that. i also wondered how the fare boxes even work. how does it collect the little paper ticket thing and coins separately. very curious. so i looked it up and looked like they have hairs that let coins fall through but keep light paper above or sth. i think.</p>
<p>Eventually arrive in yusuhara on schedule i think. i thought there would be a final stop at yusuhara and that i could just get off at final stop. but it seems there are more stops. so i just get off when someone else got off. i said can i put (my 1000 yen bill) into the fare box and they said yeah so i did that.</p>
<p>i try to find my way to where i am going, but i ended up going in many circles, looking at google map i try go all directions, all of them end up being incorrect until last try. i walked past this guy on a ladder many times, sort of afraid they ask um u need some help? or sth.</p>

<p>Eventually i seemingly made it to my destination, a tourist association. i go in and seems empty. but theres a bathroom so i use the bathroom. and i walk back out because it seems empty. and then i see the tourism association entrance is to the left of where i went in. so i went in there instead.</p>
<p>Inside, there is a person. i say to them approx: u guys doing renta cycle? (in japanese). reply: yeah. and then ask me questions about type of bike i want to rent and how long. i manage to reply, inform them i want electric assist bike for one day. they reply say to me something like: one day means u have to return it by 5 today is that ok? I say ok yeah. and then came a question that i did not fully understand. something about drivers license or id or something. i sort of froze wondering if they needed specifically drivers license or if they was asking about any id. and then another woman in back piped up said “passport”, and i unfroze oh yeah i have passport, begin take out passport. and so person takes out some paperwork for me to fill out. asks me sth in japanese if i want the english or japanese paperwork and i said oh <ruby>eigo no hou ga<rt>english</rt></ruby> so they give me the english. and asked me i think another question if i wanted the electric bike with the basket or no basket and i chose the basket.</p>
<p>the fee was i think 1650 yen + 1000 yen deposit. i put down some money and digging around for 50 yen but i cant find so i just take back the money put down a fat 5000 yen bill. i see the other person who said “passport” is pulling up a translator on their phone.</p>
<p>They walk me outside where the bike is and give some explanations, but mostly in japanese still i think, like here is the thing you can lock it if going into building. here is the headlight u can use if going through tunnel. type stuff. and so it was explained, and i headed off.</p>
<p>I bike north towards Shikoku Karst, occasionally stop take some pics of the cool views. bike through some small populated areas and etc., stop at vending machine once to get a drink.</p>

<p>Some time i entered this very long tunnel. damp and cool. took some pics. there was also a part that crosses border from kochi prefecture to ehime prefecture, they had cool illuminated signs which i took picture of as well.</p>

</figure>
<p>after exiting the long tunnel i looked on google maps and realized i had ridden past shikoku karst. and then i remember even though on google maps it kind of looks like you can go straight north and turn right to get to shikoku karst, you actually either have to go up windy road, or go through tunnel then loop around on a slightly less windy road.</p>
<p>I am already through the tunnel so i go to take the loop around. there was signs saying shikoku karst with cow and grass so it was quite easy to follow. however it was very uphill. but i have the eletric assist bike so not too much trouble, except when the bike battery died. it was 90% when i got it and its estimate said i had 50km of juice left, nice. but after riding along the road i estimate 20 or less km, it dropped to 10% and then straight to 0%.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF7388.webp" id="DSCF7388" alt="" /><figcaption>7.1 12:13 on my way to Shikokukarusuto</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>very unfortunate. and so i was stuck pushing heavy bike uphill for some number of kilometers. i thought about just stop, go back now. but almost there anyways. so keep on going.</p>
<p>make a brief stop eat one of my rice balls and drink liquid, continue on.</p>

</figure>
<p>Eventually i reach the Shikoku Karst very exhausted. they have a rental bike place there, but i believe closed on the weekday. seem to be a food place as well, but also closed.</p>
<p>i take a look. park bike. take a picture. wish i had battery to ride on into the actual karst look at grass and cows and stuff. but i have no energy. also i was not sure if i could make back in time if i spend too much time here.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF7401.webp" id="DSCF7401" alt="" /><figcaption>7.1 13:43 I am arrived</figcaption>

<p>i walk a little down the road, into some kind of campground parking lot. take a short look around, walk back to bike, begin my trip back.</p>

<p>luckily the trip back was 99.9% downhill so i just need to press brakes so i dont lose control ride off edge of cliff. i wondered if i can mount my camera to front of bike. i looped the strap through bike basket hang it from front of basket, take a video that way. took some video like that. take a break put camera back in bag, eat my last rice ball. continue on.</p>

<p>make a little stop at a shallow river section running through a populated area, step into river, the water is nice, clear, cool. nice vibes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF7480.webp" id="DSCF7480" alt="" /><figcaption>7.1 15:23 This is the river i stopped at</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I arrive back at the tourist center where i return the bicycle. i use my new vocabulary say <ruby>henkyaku shimasu<rt>i return it</rt></ruby> or sth and person gives me back my 1000 yen deposit. i use bathroom and leave. i still have about an hour before the bus come. so i walk down to some parking lot that has a river access and look at the river. i wonder if there is food establishments in the area. Looked at google maps, there seemed to be one place nearby, so i go walk over. but i couldnt find it, or it didnt seem to be actually open. i was looking around, another person looks to be looking around as well. they say sth (in japanese) like are u also looking for [name of place]?. i show them the place im searching for on my phone and they say oh i see. different place. and we look around randomly not really together but not quite separately. they say oh i think this the place you looking for right? doesnt look like they open though.. i see sign of place they looking for and i point to it. but it is unclear where the entrance is so i guess thats why they confused. but they go walk over into some kind of porch underneath the sign to see if entrance is over there. and so i turn and leave.</p>
<p>i walked through some supermarket. i saw some breads in the supermarket some students were looking at. i think i might have wanted some of that bread. but i was kind of no energy to try to buy it. i went outside and sat on a bench. the evening sun was still hot. there was some male students socializing or sth outside the super market. a pair of european-descent-looking people walked by and i think i remembered they said something in english or did something like point out oh theres a bottle recycling bin and maybe they recycled a bottle.</p>
<p>eventually the time came to wait for bus. i walk over to bus stop. even though there was schedule on bus stop saying when bus come, i was slightly worried i am at wrong place and i would miss final bus out of town. on google, it says the first stop on the route is at the bus company place itself which is a short walk away, so i decided to hurried over there perhaps board the bus as it is waiting to depart. I arrive at the bus company place and there is buses in front of the building idling but none of them look like they going to where im going (susaki). i said to guy who look like he directing the buses: susaki <ruby>yuki no basu ha<rt>bus</rt></ruby>. he sayed: i think uh its not here yet u can wait over there. so i waited over there. The other buses left. some buses came. guy signaled gestured to me and sayed “Okay” and so i boarded the bus, ride the bus.</p>
<p>the majority ridership on that bus was i believe students. Many got on at Yusuhara, gradually get off along the way. at some point i think all like five or so people on the bus was fallen asleep. except the driver and me i guess. It was the opposite bus ride of bus ride i took in the morning, take a little more than 1 hour. arrive at susaki station where i get off, again checking with driver if i can put my 1000 yen bill into fare box. yes it was ok. i pay and get off bus.</p>
<p>I go into station and buy my train ticket to next destination. then i have some amount of time before the train actully come, and i decide use this time to go eat food. Where food? Mos Burger. My reasoning for Mos Burger was that everything else around the area that was open at this time looked like izakaya. According to google maps, walking to Mos Burger one way will be approximately 28 mins. I believe walking both ways would take too much time infeasible for my schedule, so i decide that i will walk just one way (to or from), and take some transport the other way (from or to). Google map inform me there is bus that will come soon, so i guess i will take that. i go to bus stop. notice im at wrong bus stop, go to correct bus stop across the street.</p>
<p>The bus come and i get on it. According to my notes, when i got on the bus driver said to me “I’m going towards Takaoka are u good with that” and i said yeah. I am not sure why the driver told me. I theorize it may have been same bus driver, confused at why i would be getting back on bus right after got off? not sure.</p>
<p>Sit on bus Get off at a bus stop and walk over and in to the mos burger. To my dismay there was no self-order kiosk. no. just a human counter. However, this is the reason i come to japan. to overcome this kind of situations. So i keep walking in, i go over look at the menu posted to the side of the register, standing out of view of counter so that the person knows i am not yet ready to order.</p>
<p>I decided on the most basic easiest to remember thing to order. Move right, stand in front of the order counter to nonverbally declare my intent to order. A worker who look like they was being busy with some other things as well came over. i might have tried to start ordering. or maybe they hit me with the are u eating in question. or it might have been specifically “are u eating in or taking away?”, because when i responded with i think “yes”, they clarified, “ur eating in?”, to which i respond, “yes”.</p>
<p>I say something like, “Mos burger set”, and they ask about “side menu?”, gesturing to the side menu section on the menu spread across the counter. Looking at where they gesturing to i see drinks, and think a bit. i dont think i planned beforehand what drink to get. idk why not. I respond saying about “melon soda”. They reply approximately, “OK, but the side menu?”, and i realized that side menu means the section labelled “side menu” that has french fries, onion ring, etc. so i specify French Fry. i might have also specified the sizes of the drink and french fries, maybe after being asked. i do not really remember.</p>
<p>After completing payment on the customer-facing kiosk, i am given number tent and i think told to sit down. so i do it, go sit down try to look normal even though there is nobody else around to perceive me.</p>
<p>Shortly or longly later, worker comes over with melon soda on a tray and says sth like ur other food will come out later sorry, leaves. Further later different worker come over carrying my burger and fries in basket, sets it on my tray, take my number tent, saying the usual sorry for the wait! here is your [whatever you ordered]. take ur time! type deal.</p>

</figure>
<p>And so i eat my meal. some other people come in and order and sit down to eat. i hear the sound of sink behind me, sounds like someone washing they hands. and i realize this mos burger probably has a nice out-of-bathroom sink. so even though i am almost done with meal i go over and wash my hands with the nice water flow sink, soap, and dry hands with paper towels. great feeling. i didnt wash my hands before eating even though i remember feeling “hmm my hands probably arent very clean” before touching my food. i guess i forgot that bathrooms and sinks existed in the moment or sth.</p>
<p>i finish my food and return my tray and leave. I walk back to the station, enjoy to see the unfamiliar but slightly unremarkable scenery as i walk along the roads. Take some pictures along the way. Lightly jog some times to make sure i do not accidentally miss train. It was becoming dark, and it was become dark by the time i reach the station.</p>

<p>Im riding the train. i think this was the train where i sat at the very back left seats. and at some point some olderish guy who gave slight mentally unstable vibes i.e. in the peripheral vision not very groomed and take off they sandals put they bare feet on the back of seat and stuff sat across the aisle from me in the very back right seats. i was slightly unsettled but apart from putting they feet on the back of seat a bit i guess everything else was normal, and they buy some ticket-related thing from ticket checker person seemingly normally, so i was settled i guess.</p>
<p>train arrive at the final destination at 9pm (according to official schedule, 8:59pm) where i get off, walk over to this night’s accommodation. the walk over was quite dark. maybe i could have found and walked along a more lit street, but i walked in the dark along a not-lit street. as i understood from google maps, there was a river bank to my right i could access and walk along if i found a stairs to it. i did see a stairs to it, but i also saw someone walking up the stairs. so i didnt really want to walk up the stairs in case it seemed suspicious why is someone following me in the dark. so i just walked on hoped there would be another stairs.</p>

<p>i keep walking but unfortunately there was no access to the river until an intersection where i need to turn left away from river to continue to lodging. but i wanted to see the river so i turned right and walked a little along the river. i tried to take a pic of night sky. but even though it was kind of dark i think the light pollution was still present. i continue on my way to accommodation.</p>

<img src="media/DSCF7620.webp" id="DSCF7620" alt="" /><figcaption>7.1 21:35 on my way</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I arrive at the accommodation. there is a height difference shoe area indicating i should probably take shoes off. but there was also a sign in the window of what seemed like it should be the front desk saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>いらっしゃいませ。宿泊受付は2階です。靴のまま、お上がりください。(i know this is what it says bc i took a picture later)</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>and to my knowledge it was saying “the reception (check in desk?) for lodging stuff is on 2nd floor. come up wearing ur shoes as-is”. but i wasnt too sure about the shoes part (靴のまま) because i dont actually know japanese and also because of the presence of the height-different shoe area thing. so i just went up without my shoes figured it would be better to accidentally not wear shoes than to accidentally wear shoes.</p>
<p>i went up to the second floor. there was a sign saying reception and a door. so i tried opening the door. uh it seemed like this was not the correct way to get receiption, so i quietly closed the door. i notice there is a customer-facing window thing in the wall next to the door, oh thats probably where i need to go.</p>
<p>I see someone through the window, but they dont see me. idrk what to do in this situation. im guessing maybe correct thing would to verbally say sumimasen check in desu or something. but i dont want to go verbal thats embarassing. i also dont want to like knock on the window because that seems sort of rude. so i think i sort of noisly touch slide the window a little to make enough noise to be noticeable, at which point they notice me. i dont really remember entire check-in process, but i do know they took, probably copied passport. and also i remember they said to themselves sth like “america, huh?” looking at my passport. they also gesture to like down the hall is the bath room. and stuff.</p>
<p>i walk over to my room. i didnt take any pictures of the hallway but i wish i had. it was very.. retro? but not super old retro. like maybe what i imagine 90s soulless office would feel like?. im not sure if the light bulbs were fluorescent, but they felt like they was. go into my room. it is a physical key, dont automatically lock type lock. room is a similar vibe, sort of like retro in the way that it is not purposely retro but it has simply just been like that since a long while ago, well-maintained enough that it simply has not changed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20250701_214507.webp" id="20250701_214507" alt="" /><figcaption>7.1 21:45 The room also has that sort of retro sterile office vibe to it. cool</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>i take the provided towel left in the TV stand next to a toothbrush, go to the bath room. the bath rooms was labelled very plainly with hand-written signs hung on the door, i think “男湯” and “女湯”. i remember the woman bath room door was strangely higher than the man bathroom door.</p>
<p>i enter the man bath room, press some switches which cause lights to flicker on after a brief delay, a fan (literally a fan mounted on the wall i believe) turns on. put my stuff in basket, enter the (bath) bath room. i shower myself. i peek under the bath folding cover thingy and see that yes, there is a bath prepared. but i currently have healing wounds so i think maybe bath is not great for me or future bath users, so i exit do not bathe, dry self, exit the bath room, turning over my basket because i heard thats what ur supposed to do in public baths. idrk if it applied in this situation, but i did it anyway.</p>
<p>i enjoyed lying on the floor, futon of the japanese-style room. i charge my camera batteries and phone a bit i think, look at google maps and etc. try to theorize what i will do tomorrow.</p>
<p>i go to sleep.</p>
