<p>I woke up some time and took shower and reserved JR pass online and ate breakfast and check out.</p>
<p>My plans are all going to plan. i walk over to kagoshima central station to pick up the JR pass. the ticket office had a small line shortly after seven AM which was slightly concerning what if it takes too long and i miss the 7:32 train??. However, it dont take too long i soon walk up to a free counter and pick up the JR pass do not take very long.</p>

</figure>
<p>According to my records i was on the platform waiting for train at a comfortable 7:20. you can just put the JR pass into the shinkansen gates and it lets you through, wow!. It comes and i ride it to hakata. at hakata when i get off shinkansen there was a sign saying transfer here for sonic train very straightforward. i went through those gates with jr pass. easy find the platform and train, board it.</p>
<p>when the ticket checker person come around i show the JR pass. they asked where i am going and i said kokura. okay</p>
<section id="why-did-they-ask-where-im-going-to" class="aside">
<h2>why did they ask where im going to?</h2>
<p>I wondered why they asked me where im going to. After riding some more trains and theorizing, this is my theory why they asked:</p>
<p>JR “limited express” trains require that you have a special “limited express” seat ticket IN ADDITION to the basic fare ticket (more detail in a future “Tickets” aside). However, there is no separate gate/area for limited express trains. So technically you can board “limited express” trains without having a “limited express” ticket (i think you can usually buy the limited express seat ticket on the train itself as well). This is why i believe they have the ticket checker people occasionally walk around check peoples tickets.</p>
<p>But they only check Your ticket once per trip. Keep checking ticket each stop would be a hassle, right?. Yet people get on and off at each stop. So how do they prevent checking same person over and over??. I have theorized and also read online that the way they do this is for each person checked, they mark down on a seat chart where the person is getting off. And so as long as that seat is occupied before that station, do not need to re-check. This is my understanding.</p>
<p>However, the JR kyushu pass allows you to ride limited express trains with only your pass. i.e. you don’t have an actual separate limited express ticket that states where you are going. And to put me down on the seat chart they would need to know where im getting off. And so that is why they probably asked me where i am going to. This is my conclusion.</p>
</section>
<p>i get off at kokura station. i exit the gates because the shinkansen between kokura and shin-yamaguchi is not included in my JR kyushu pass they say, so i must buy the shinkansen ticket manually.</p>
<section id="shinkansen-between-hakata-and-kokura-isnt-covered-either-by-the-jr-pass-i-believe." class="aside">
<h2>shinkansen between hakata and kokura isnt covered either by the jr pass i believe.</h2>
<p>idk why. i think its considered part of the “sanyou shinkansen” which isnt considered part of jr kyushu.. that is why i transfered to sonic at hakata to save some money. the sonic is included in jr kyushu pass.</p>
</section>
<p>unfortunately there was a mini line at the ticket machine. uh oh!. i try to look for a different ticket machine but i wasnt sure if it could vend shinkansen tickets so i figured my best option maybe was wait in the queue hope it goes quick.</p>
<p>eventually my turn came and i buy as fast as possible, run to gates, run to platform escalator. walk up the escalator. except there is two people blocking both sides of the escalator prevent anybody to pass</p>
<p>i try to look like i want to pass but they either dont notice or dont gaf. i look at my phone and its 9:52, train departs at 9:52. I hear the departing melody. i try to say like uhh excuse me but nothing happens. I hear the person talking into the announcement something like: We Are Leaving Now Doors Are Closing. The people in front of me stand as still as ever. i squeeze myself between them and run up remaining escalator, into the train.</p>
<p>im on the train, i think i walk around wondering where the nonreserved cars are. i probably walk through all of them eventually find at the very ends where they is already full and people is standing in the space between cars. so i stand there with them. anyways, i ride only one stop 18 minutes duration.</p>
<p>i reach Shin Yamaguchi station and get off, exit the shinkansen gates, walk over to the regular JR train area. I wait for the ticket machine marked as you can pick up ticket reservation. waiting behind some station employee showing someone how to buy some ticket. at some point the person dropped some receipt on floor and i picked it up to give it to them but they was in middle of tutorial and idrk what to say so i just stood there holding it wondering if i should put it back on ground pretend i never saw it because dont actually seem important. but eventually they finish and the station person turned.. to me, so i gave it to the station person with zero context and like sign languaged that that person dropped it. it took some effort before i think station person understood and sayed “oh they dropped this?” or so and so gave it to that person.</p>
<p>and so i now use the ticket machine, i use it to pick up a tickets i reserved a few days ago to ride “Steam Locomotive yamaguchi”. cool.</p>
<p>However, actually I only booked a Going ticket and not a Returning ticket. i.e. i had a ticket going to its final destination (Shin Yamaguchi to Tsuwano) but not returning from Tsuwano to Shin Yamaguchi.</p>
<p>So i was looking around how i buy a returning ticket. It did not seem that the ticket machine is letting me buy it.. not sure.. and it was getting close to the departure time and i have heard i dont think its possible to buy the returning ticket at Tsuwano..?. So, i went to the Ticket Office go talk to a person.</p>
<p>To try to communicate i want to buy a returning ticket i tried to show them my Going ticket and say “i got shin yamaguti to tuwano .. can i get tuwano to sin yamaguti pls”.</p>
<p>They seemed to understood. they sayed: oh theres actually a green car seat available. so i sayed ok green car pls. and i bought it and got it. wow great!</p>
<section id="green-car-seat" class="aside">
<h2>green car seat</h2>
<p>green car is like first class seat i think. bigger seats and such. idk why its called green.</p>
</section>
<p>And so i went through the gates and went to the platform where the train was just pulling up wow cool!. And i looked at the train and stuff.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF3913.webp" id="DSCF3913" alt="" /><figcaption>6.21 10:37 Here, you can see the train.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Eventually it was time to board the train so i was looking at all my tickets just to make sure they are correct, and i notice that i have three pieces of ticket paper. Two of the pieces of ticket paper correspond to Going trip (shin-yamaguchi to tsuwano), and one of the ticket paper correspond to Returning trip (tsuwano to shin-yamaguchi).</p>
<p>That concerned me because why is the Going trip require 2 paper while Return trip only has 1 paper. so i went to some person that looked like a train station employee and said sth like “<ruby>boku gaikokujin desukedo<rt>im not japanese</rt></ruby>” and then idrk what else but i remember i held the three tickets in such a configuration that it resembled a rectangle with a missing quadrant to give a visual representation of missingness.</p>
<p>The person pondered and said sth like uh yeah you probably need the thing and then went over and consulted with other people. I follow and listening and what i got from that is i am missing “<ruby>fare ticket<rt>乗車券</rt></ruby>” for returning trip. and the people said i can buy it on the train later. ok! so i board the train.</p>
<section id="tickets" class="aside">
<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>This experience of missing ticket caused me to understood more about how the JR tickets work. I had before noticed that some train required two tickets to ride for some reason. For example, the Shinkansen. They divide the ticket up into two fees. One is like some base fee, and then the other fee seems to depend on what seat you get, e.g. reserved seating i guess is more expensive. I believe I have now come to know that the base thing is “<ruby>fare ticket<rt>乗車券</rt></ruby>” which is i think based on what distance the train is travelling, and then the other thing is like the “everything else” ticket (e.g. limited express + free seating, limited express + reserved seating, regular train + reserved seat, shinkansen super express + free seating, etc.).</p>
<p>In this case i had a fare ticket and reserved seat ticket (there was no free seating. whole train is reserved+green seats) for my ride over, which was correct. But I only had a green seat ticket for my ride back, i.e. i am missing the fare ticket. Ok that makes sense</p>
</section>
<p>i found my seat and sat down. the seat configurations is a box of four seats. Two benches of two facing each other with a table in the middle. I sit in the aisle seat, across from seems to be a grandma come along with the family in the seats across the aisle from us. The window seats in our box was occupied by seems like middle-age couple.</p>
<p>I saw on the info sheet on the table that the choo choo train had wifi. Interesting! So, I connected to the wifi. As I am connecting, a person from before unexpectedly came over to i believe sell me my returning fare ticket. i guess they remembered my face or seat number. they said cash only u got cash? i said uhhh… looking at my leftover 390 yen. i said that ill buy it later or sth and the guy left.</p>
<p>The train soon depart. I get up and look around the train. It has toilets and sinks wow. I use a toilet and sink. the automatic sink dispenses a full flow of water and also has a bottle of soap to use with it, wow. It also has a commemorative stamp which i use. Nice</p>
<p>the train makes a few brief stops before reaching a long stop. At this long stop, i get off with many people to look at the train from the outside. it is neat. soon, back on the train. Train makes another long stop, can look at train from outside again. Cool. Back on train, reaches final destination Tsuwano.</p>

<p>At tsuwano, get off and walk to the Train Turntable. There I wait for the engine part of the train to come over and be Turned. It does come, and is Turned and docks and seems to undergo some maintenance. I leave.</p>

<p>I go walk to a shrine that i saw on google maps and i think i heard mentioned in a train announcement and saw in youtube video. But first, i stop by a Lawson on the way i looked up earlier with train wifi. Luckily, the ATM worked and i withdrew cash. I go to buy a bottle of water to have a bottle of water and also to break a 10000 yen bill. The worker was unusually nonverbal and there was a long awkward moment after they scanned my single bottle of water where i had my 10000 yen bill and i wasnt sure uh i hand it to them or something else? and they just stood there no movements or indication of nothing. i think they also left temporarily to do something and came back and resumed the same stance. confused, i placed my bill in the money tray. and then they silently took it from the tray and processed the payment and i took change and water and left.</p>
<p>i then make my way to the shrine which u climb up a bunch of stairs covered by shrine gates on the side of a mountain hill thing. then you can enjoy the scenery at the top. i did that and walked back down. Walk back to the station, i walked through a neat looking street.</p>

</figure>
<p>Back at the station i went to ticket desk people and showed them my return ticket and sayed sth like i dont have fare ticket for this can i buy it here and they sayed sth like yeah cash only and sold me it.</p>
<p>Then i still had like an hour before the returning train departs, and also i was hungry had not eaten anything that day yet. On google maps i saw some close-by restaurant that had positive reviews from non japanese people so it look approachable.</p>
<p>I go there, it kind of look intimidating. Where i enter the shop was also confusing. However there was english signage and also someone eating there so it was slightly less intimidating. I sort of stick my head in, someone notice me probably sayed to sit over there orso. I think someone gave me pitcher of barley tea or just told me to help myself to the pitcher already on table.</p>
<p>I order the thing labelled as most popular (they had menu outside so i decided already before enter store), which was udon with rice balls. But then they sayed sth about <ruby>tanpin<rt>à la carte</rt></ruby> which confused me a bit bc i assumed the thing on menu only referred to the set of udon + rice balls. but i think i successfully conveyed i wanted the rice balls set. but then they asked sth about <ruby>large portion<rt>大盛り</rt></ruby>, i was a bit confused and lost. so i just agreed sayed yes please even though they were probably just asking me whether i wanted the large portion or not.</p>

</figure>
<p>I ate it yummy. Paid and leave. Walk back to station. Take some pics of train, go board train.</p>
<p>I make my way to my seat which is at very front of train. my first time sit in a green car seat cool! put my bag in the overhead rack and sit in seat and also take a peek into the green car lounge section thing, can see back of the train engine and etc.</p>
<p>there is also now a section at back of train which is open-air deck. cool. idk if on the way over it had it because i think on the way over the back car was green car which you cant (shouldnt) go in unless you got a seat.</p>
<p>i end up spending most of the approx 1 hr 45 min train ride back standing in that open-air observation deck, taking pictures and videos and standing.</p>

<section id="people-waving-at-train" class="aside">
<h2>people waving at train</h2>
<p>During the train rides, the people in the train often mutually wave to the people outside of the train while passing by. The people outside of the train for example included the train staff at stations, people that come to see train but not ride it at stations. Persons working in field. Persons have tripods set up film train. Some guy on motorcycle. Some looks like students. Et cetera.</p>
</section>
<p>The train occasionally go through tunnel which cause more train exhaust than usual circulate in that deck. idk if you supposed to go back inside when enter those tunnels, but there were so many, often short, and nobody else really went back inside. so i did not either.</p>
<p>I maybe should have wore mask though because i cannot imagine inhaling it raw would be very healthy. However, it did not trigger my asthma which is good. My booger did come out black later that night, though.</p>
<p>Eventually reach Shin Yamaguchi. Get off. Good bye SL Yamaguchi. I go to exit, but there was a line. According to my Japanese Comprehension Skills, it was if you dont want the automatic gates to eat your ticket, you can get your tickets manually cancelled by a human so can take it home as souvenir. Sounds cool! I did that and left.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/DSCF4266.webp" id="DSCF4266" alt="" /><figcaption>6.21 18:22 Took this pic from shin-yamaguchi station I think</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I took an equivalent trains back to hakata, i.e. shinkansen from shin yamaguti to kokura, sonic from kokura to hakata. I took a mini nap/doze on the sonic train, where the seat was slightly broken kept reclining under weight of my body.</p>
<p>At Hakata station i remember being disoriented from waking up from nap and also having no wifi to look up what train to take or whatever. I think I basically just looked at the platform signs and looked for approx where i wanted to go (i was planning on going to/towards Saga). And i ended up boarding a limited express train bound for Nagasaki (which stopped at Saga).</p>
<p>The unreserved seats were full again, so i stood in the space between cars, along with another person. Quite tired, i alternate between squatting against a wall and stand. Someone come through and check our tickets, i show them my JR pass.</p>
<p>After first stop i went and looked for a free seats in case someone got up left. I was delighted to find a free seats, it was still warm. I sat in it and settled down. And then someone came over and said something to me and i looked at the signs above the door and realised i was in a reserved seat car. and i was probably sitting in someones seat. that is so awkward oops!. And to make it more awkward, i got out of seat but they and they party was kinda confused or sth figuring sth out blocking aisle out of the car so i just stood there for a bit wait for them to be seated or sth. someone else in they party asked me something, i think sth concerning why i was sitting there. i tried to say sth like uh <ruby>matigaimasita<rt>i made an oopsies?</rt></ruby> as i leave the area never to be seen again.</p>
<p>And so I think i returned to my place between the cars and rode the rest of my way to Saga. I noticed that i sometimes hallucinated the whistle of choo choo train in my brain.</p>
<p>The train arrived at saga like 2-3 mins late. I believe it was scheduled for 20:40 arrival and it arrived at like 20:42 or 20:43. and i heard they was saying sorry for being late on the announcements as i was getting off which reminded me of the internet meme haha japan is so punctual and apologetic and stuff. but after spending the morning making tight transfers only possible with trains that followed the schedules, i kind of become understood why being on schedule makes sense.</p>
<p>I then took an approx 30 minute night stroll to an internet cafe, kaikatsu club. Why net cafe? I think on weekends hotels is more expensive. so i believe net cafe was significantly cheaper. I think. Or maybe i just wanted to stay in net cafe.</p>
<p>I reach the kaikatsu club. Kaikatsu club is largest net cafe chain in japan and you need to register membership before you use. I did not have membership so i plan to register at this store in Saga.</p>
<p>I walk in and say something like “<ruby>I am Not Japanese<rt>僕、外国人ですけど</rt></ruby> <ruby>but can i get a membership<rt>会員証登録できますか</rt></ruby>” and the person i think consult someone else or sth idrk and then asked for passport or so, guided me through the registration process and get a room. The interesting or unusual part though was that they spoke in japanese for whole process. most situations like this in my japan experiences most people will at least try to switch to english when explaining simple things like “please your name and address” when telling you to fill out your name and address, but they just powered through the whole thing in seemingly full keigo japanese. And when they was explaining the net cafe rules it was all in japanese, and then they ask if there was any unclear parts/i had any questions or sth, so i asked in broken japanese uh what was this part u talked about (pointing to same spot they pointed to on the sheet of rules), and they were like “umm…” and then clarified the part.. in japanese.</p>
<section id="specifying-your-birth-date" class="aside">
<h2>specifying your birth date</h2>
<p>When im specifying my birth date on the the registration sheet it seemed like u have to specify your birth year in that japanese era year thing that corresponds to the change of emperors or something. idk what my birth year is converted into that years so i asked “what is this” and they said oh u dont have to do that, i believe. so i crossed it out or something just wrote the four digit year.</p>
</section>
<p>That was cool and interesting experience. But i got a room which was a “wide room” i have to pay two peoples worth bc they said the other (key-locked private) rooms was full.. i kind of wished i had just gotten a booth after i said ok ill do the two-ppl wide room one.. but oh well</p>
<p>I took a shower and then ordered curry and french fries on the food ordering system. and after i ordered it i was google translating a message i didnt understand and came to know that they would let me know my order is done via intercom telephone. which made me stressed because i didnt know that would happen and idk if i would have ordered if i knew i had to answer a phone.</p>
<p>However the call came and i said <ruby>はい<rt>hai</rt></ruby> and the person said something about the food being ready that i didnt really understand. and then i said “ok thank you” except extremely botched, and so the intercom call was done.</p>
<p>i approx knew from watching youtube, etc. that u go to a eating place and they will have set the food down on the table you specified when ordering. I went there and the food was there, covered in plastic wrap. Yum. I ate it. The curry had no substance, like a rice with gravy. The french fries uh.. idrk. they were cool i guess. they came with lemon. and the mayonaiaise and ketchup that i ordered. Maybe i should have ordered the katsu curry instead of just a curry.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then i do my night routine and probably try to trip plan a little for tomorrow. I remember looking up some sightseeing trains or sth, but i realised they weren’t covered completely with my JR pass, and they schedules did not seem too appealing. so i end up not really concluding anything and probably just tired go to sleep.</p>
