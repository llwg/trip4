# day 8: Fun on Miyakojima

I wake up ready to leave. I fix my glasses a little better by replacing my notebook label with that tape they put on to stuff you buy to signify that you paid for it.

I leave the room ready for the new day. shortly after leave, i remember i forgot to close window, so i went back close window, re-leave.

Walk into town. it was 6 or 7am. Passed by a park. There was a swing, so i swung on it. There was an interesting looking slide structure. i hit my head when entering it, and it was too small inside so i left.

![6.27 7:07 Interesting slide structure](DSCF6241.JPG)

![6.27 7:08 Cool bird](DSCF6244.JPG)

Walk more into town. Its time to eat breakfast. So i look for a food place on google maps.

There is only like one place along the path i am planning on going. Ok so i go there. But when i arrive, i think it was either a buffet which i didnt want, or just vibes were off. So i dont want to enter. Instead, i walk shortly over to my good friend Joyfull.

At the joyfull i got the breakfast meal yushitofu drink bar included large rice + hijiki.

![6.27 7:57 Yumm food](20250627_075752.jpg)

I didnt know what "yushi tofu" was when i order it. photo just looked good. It was like a tofu salty water soup pretty good. Also now that i look it up it is apparently okinawa specialty food so that is nice that i accidentally picked it. and now that i further think about it i remember there was a whole segment on it in the okinawa anime i watched so idk how i forgot it.

I took my time eating my breakfast which was quite large and fulfilling. My next plans of the day was to buy shorts and maybe a shirt or tshirt from a store. and then, rent a bicycle. However most/all the store open at like uh 9am. and now it is 8am. So i am taking my time.

# Why did not the english menu say drink bar included?
The joyfull ordering tablet has multiple language option so im switching between japanese and english. and i noticed that the japanese menu name for my meal says [ドリンクバー付](drink bar included) at the end. But the english does not mention anything about drink bar. Hm.

# yuzu kombu tea at the drink bar machine
I was trying out some of the drinks at the drink bar machines and there was one say yuzu kombu tea. hmm whats that taste like?. It came out hot, and does taste like uh. citrus and seaweed. tea? idk since its sort of salty taste more like soup. Interesting taste.
:::

The joyfull was not too busy at this time. Some people though. There was one large party of sound like middle age men in a work-related relationship.

I eventually finish food, pay, and leave. I walk over to place i see on google maps look to have clothing. It is soon to opening time.

![6.27 8:47 Walking over](DSCF6268.JPG)

I sit on a concrete cube seat thing outside some building waiting for 9am. I see some other people seemingly assembling to enter a store at opening hours. I see some people start entering the grocery store in same shopping center. so i enter it to look around.

Inside it looked like a grocery store. My mom said to send pics of grocery store products so i took some pics. While leaving, i grabbed a snack [pine](pineapple) from near the entrance i saw when entering. I saw snack pine in the anime, it looks like an interesting small pineapple you can eat.. maybe with just your hands no tools? not sure. So i bought it. Looks to be no self register, I go through human register. The human at the human register says "its good like this?" put into a thin produce bag. I say yeah. I got some cash to pay. They gesture to the bill slot on the cash input machine, which is surprisingly vertical instead of horizontal. first time ive seen a vertical one in any country i think. I take the change from the machine, and the product from the human, and I leave.

Outside i sit on the same concrete cube and put my snack pine in my bag. It wears on its bottom that styrofoam(?) springy wrapping thing you see wrapped around fat pears. It is currently folded in such a way that two layers protect the bottom of the pine. i unfold it so that one layer protects both the bottom but also top of the pine. I put it back in its produce bag and wrap it in my small towel, and place it in my backpack.

I then enter the clothing store look at the clothing.

There are some okinawa souvenier tshirts. There is a okinawa "kariyushi" shirts section. There are also some shorts. I see.

I think i was looking for shorts but honestly i forget. shorts was probably a general guideline and idk what i was actually doing. Idk what i was looking for but i probably felt i could not find it, so i left and walked 16 minutes to "Big 1" store.

![6.27 9:46 Big 1](DSCF6274.JPG)

I had rougly heard that "Big 1". or "Big 2" or idrk was a regional local discount store type deal, and it sounded cool. So i arrived, and i looked at the clothing section, which had approximately nothing. I think by then i had decided i was also looking for indoor shoes i could wear inside a gym. and Big 1 did not have what i wanted. so i left and walked 16 mins back to original clothing store, where i went to the second floor and looked at the daiso and shoes and etc.

There were some shoes labelled as indoor shoes but they just looked white sneakers. they were too heavy and bulky for me to carry around. not good. There were also some wetshoes i considered maybe get. i saw someone at fukuoka gym wear what looks like wetshoes. However, even those wetshoes felt too much mass carry around. so i didnt buy it.

I eventually decide buy a pair of synthetic fabric shorts. I could use another pair of shorts in case one gets wet. or to wear while the other is in laundry machine. My current pair of shorts i had either not washed for 8 days, or i think i might have washed them in the sink on day 5. I am 70% sure i gave them a rough hand-wash in the sink on day 5. but for some reason i cant completely remember. maybe i was drunk off of the spicy ethanol seasoning i put in my noodles.

So i had picked my synthetic shorts and just browsing around other stuff. and then i hit some indecision maybe get different shorts. Eventually i got different shorts made of cotton instead. I bring it to the check-out counter and had it checked out in exchange for money, and i left.

I am done shopping, ready to go rent the bicycle. I walk shortly to the bicycle rental place and engage the guy inside the building. i forget what i said but probably something about rentacycle and he was like oh yeah when do u want to return it. that was an unexpected question (because i wasnt really expecting anything i guess). i said "uhhhh" and like looked at the small desk calendar that was on the counter and said "uh tomorrow" while trying to point out tomorrow on the calendar. and he said "oh ok, [the actual date that is tmrw]?" and i said yes. Some paperwork was pulled out and guy said sth like ok pls fill out xyz. ok. and then idk if it was bc i started filling out my name and whatever in english or bc my ass japanese or bc what but then he switched to speaking the very brief english like "uh passport? copy OK?" etc. but luckily english is my first language so i had no problem.

filled everything out. he went out and pulled out the bike. i stood there standing and watch as he check/pump the back tire air (pretty sure not front tire) and also take a telephone call while doing it. It was done and he might have said sth like uh this is the brakes (idk if he actually said that). and then um. said like OK and left. or something along those lines. so i rode off. without a helmet i believe. i think this was only bike rental i had in japan that did not give me or offer me a helmet.

I rode off without any particular destination in mind. and once i am far enough from bike shop i wonder: hmm wonder where i am should be going right now?. And i decide this: Go to A&W burger and buy food and eat it at beach. So, i go bike to the A&W.

Arrive at the A&W. i stand outside a bit looking at menu mentally prepare myself what to order. Enter, walk up to the order counter. i think first question was "are you eating in?" (in japanese) which i wasnt prepared for. but i tried to answer uh takeout (but in japanese). but i guess it wasnt japanese enough i dont think they understood so switched over to english or something mode. Ordering a food, idk if i was saying it in "japanese" or "english" because the menu names are like "The A&W burger set" but in japanese phonology so even if you say it in english its like saying it in japanese but with weird accent. but regardless of how i was trying to order i guess the person still couldnt understand me and so pulled out the chinese menu which i couldnt read anything so i pointed to the item on the actual menu and i think that helped and eventually ordered successfully.

gave me a number tent, wait at table. when food ready, brought it to table (in the takeaway bag and stuff). ok thanks i leave.

::: aside
# A&W
a and w is that america root beer brand i think. but they have burger chain in okinawa. apparently also elsewhere in world including usa, but i dont think i have ever seen one in places ive been in usa.
:::

put my food in my bike basket along with my backpack, set off to "sunayama beach". Bike along. sunny day. I saw a cruise ship docked and large crowd of people near it. I saw some mannequin dressed as uh traffic safety mascot or something. it seems to be a miyakojima mascot. I also saw a peacock(?) looking bird crossing the road.

![6.27 11:57 I have heard this is called the so called "宮古島まもる君"](DSCF6291.JPG)

![6.27 12:08 I only got this one picture of this majestical mystical bird](DSCF6298.JPG)

I arrived at a parking lot. i tried cycling past the parking lot but it turned to sand, so i turned back and parked at the parking lot. Take my stuff and walk up the path. There was seemingly a couple was taking a pictures at the path. They say: go ahead. i gesture point at they phone and take photo of them signifying u want me take picture of u guys with ur phone?, and they agreed, and i took they phone and took a bunch of photos of them to my best of ability and they said thank you! in english and i said you're welcome nonverbally and went on my way.

# I stepped in an uncomfortably warm large puddle outside the bathrooms in the parking lot
There was large puddle of water in front of bathroom changing room in the parking lot, maybe because some drain was clogged or maybe there was no drain in the first place. i accidentally stepped in it and it was uncomfortably warm and felt gross.

:::

I reached the beach. the sand was very white and the water was very clear. The color of the ocean looked very turquoise. It was the stereotypical epic resort small island in middle of pacific ocean type vibe beach. wow cool.

There was some plastic tables with umbrella and chairs propped against the tables that strangely nobody was using. idk if this was because most ppl were just here to take photos and feel water and leave or because there was some sign i couldnt understand saying dont use these tables. idrk. people that went into the water seemed to just use a shady area next to the rocky wall and not the tables.

so idrk what was up with the tables but i sat down at one and ate my a&w food. root beer that was already ice melted and i drank some on the way and spilled a little. Burger which tasted like burger. Fries which tasted like fries. Delicious. Took some pictures. though not very many imo given how impressional the beach was. maybe it was just too hot and bright, and i was scared that sand was going to destroy my camera.

![6.27 12:17 Arrive at the beach](DSCF6305.JPG)

![6.27 12:22 Hell yeah](DSCF6309.JPG)

![6.27 13:24 Wow](DSCF6323.JPG)

![6.27 13:25 Wow](DSCF6329.JPG)

finish and clean up my stuff all my trash back in the plastic bag to carry around with me until i find a trash can. i walk back to the parking lot. i tripped and fell walking up the sandy incline which was very embarassing especially because there was other people around. but luckily my camera didnt hit the sand.

At the parking lot i went into the shower/changing room which smelled pretty bad and took off my inner-pants and walked back to the beach. it is time to go swimming!.

Put my bag and stuff at the shady rocky wall place and went into the ocean. it was very nice. frolic in the water. i accidentally puncture or scrape toe on a sharp rock which was unfortunate.

after unspecified time of frolic in water, shake sand out of my pockets in water and rise from the water to dry off a bit. There was a party of seems to be young woman have an unprecedented fun to hit a ball around.

After dried a bit, gather belongings and walk back to parking lot. Unlock bike and ride off. dont think i really knew where exactly go next. approx go south, maybe east a bit. not sure yet.

riding along, downhill. was not being very careful , i think i was switching from sidewalk to street but rode too close sidewalk-street concrete bump barrier thing and um dont remember exactly what happened but essentially almost tipped over and took a fall on the bike, except i managed to stop the fall but hit the back of my left leg pretty hard with the bike pedal. immediately started swelling up. so i compressed it by tie around it a gauze-like disposable cotton bath-towel i got at some previous accomodation but kept because it was nice.

![6.27 14:00 Riding along](DSCF6335.JPG)

I decide to stop at the don quihote. it is on the way south. So i stop at it, park the bike and walk in. Yes, a don quihote. i looked for uh like. souvenir tshirt. and indoor shoes probably. None of souvenir clothing looked inspiring. but i did happen upon some wet-shoes that looked lightweight and compact enough to carry around. But actually they were labelled as "snorkeling socks" so i guess not really wet-shoes. but seemed like i could maybe get by with them in gym so i bought them. As well as two bottles of water and a juice box.

![6.27 14:33 Awesome its Don Quihote](DSCF6347.JPG)

The check-out was a configuration i had never encountered before: a human scans the items and put them in bag if u want and then give u the bag and you pay using the self kiosk at the end of the register lane. actually i guess seven eleven does that except their self kiosk is next to register instead of slightly further away from register.

i drank my juice i think and throw it away in a little trash area of the don quihote entrance. Oh there is a trash area!., i notice. I have some trash.. in my bike basket. so i go get my trash from my bike basket which was my a&w waste and some plastic bottles. To be less obvious that i am going back in just to throw away trash i put the trash in my backpack and walk in with my backpack.

::: aside
# i left my phone in the phone holder on the bike
when i arrived back to my bike i realized i had left my phone in the phone holder on the bike. the screen facing the hot sun. oopsies. i guess i didnt notice bc my pockets were still moist so i was currently storing the stuff i usually store in pockets (e.g. wallet, phone) in my backpack
:::

i um successfully disposed of one water bottle. they had signs saying pls take off the label, put in the trash place. put the bottle in the bottle place. put the cap in the cap place. and uh looking in the bottle place, it seems most ppl did not do that. so i wonder do i have to do it. but i just did it. and when im finishing doing it, some trash collector manager person come along doing something with the trash. so i act like i am done and leave. even though i have more to dispose of. because the signs says !!no household trash!!, and even though i am not really household, it feels kind of uh.. idk awkward or wrong to throw away my plastic bag of trash. and my larger-than-average 1L water bottle. idrk why but it does.

So i act like i am not waiting for person to be done with garbage. pace walking around the game arcade claw machine stuff. It is quite a while the person spends at the garbage.. i am just waiting. use a phone and such. Finally, they disappear. so i go throw away my stuff. i notice all the bottles now have they labels and caps removed so i guess thats what the person was doing. as i am finishing dispose of my stuff, the person was back i think to collecting those bottles. thanks person

so i finally leave the don quihote. maybe it was this time leaving that i saw/heard someone being solicited by what appeared to be some kind of sales person with they table set up in front of the donki.

Idrk where to go next. But then i decide, maybe i go to the airport. The Miyako airport. The one in the middle of the actual miyakojima. because ive never been there and will never be there. and its close-by, and maybe there is an outlet i can charge my phone. Earlier in the donki hote i saw an outlet behind a TV display i wanted to plug my charger in charge my phone.. my phone battery was sort of low. 16% when i left the donki.

So i rode the bike over to the airport. i dont really know where to put the bike. because conceptually i dont really know if bike is something you ride up to the airport and park and walk in. So i parked the bike sort of away from the airport, away from the actual entrance where people come in and out. on a sidewalk. And i walked into the airport.

It was airport. and there was an outlet on a wall near some waiting seats. perfect. it probably looks OK if i use it charge phone right?. idk. So i put my bag down and plug in charger and charging phone squatting down in front of my bag and stuff because the outlet is near the ground.

I am there, planning where to go next and stuff. i also got up use the bathroom once.

I sort of wanted to go south-er to see the south coast of miyakojima. But calculating how much time it would take and how much time i have left in day, i think maybe it is not worth it. Instead i decide to go straight to "Kurima island" where my accomodation was for the night. And i am sure it will be nice to explore Kurima island a bit if i have more time left in the day.

So i bike towards kurima island. cool bike ride, the clear big blue sky above and the poofy white clouds, bike through an agricultural roads. if you seen in anime those scenes where the person peacefully biking through countryside, it was like one of those scenes. I stopped by a family mart and bought some food to carry with me, plan to perhaps eat it for dinner on a beach of kurima island during sunset or so.

i saw there was a sidewalk/pedestrian-type path to my right, but no obvious access, a bunch of greenery and drainage ditch thing between me and it. I think i had gone past the access point. but i didnt want to turn back and find access point. so i just continued on my way.

At some point there was a maybe-access point to the path that looked like it was crossable/people might have crossed it before, so i cross over, push my bike a bit dangerously up the steep incline.

And so i biked along that short section of sidewalk/concrete path thing, which looked out to the "Yonaha bay". it might have been low tide or sth because the shores looked kinda dried-up and muddy.

![6.27 16:48 Looks muddy](DSCF6380.JPG)

There was some stair-like access to the water so i parked bike and walked down. looked kinda muddy and gross so didnt really want to go into water area. but i took one more step down, slipped immediately and land on my back. i was more concerned about my camera not breaking than myself so i didnt use hands to try to break fall, and so my right elbow hit concrete pretty hard and got some sort of scratch or cut or idrk. ouchies!.

i carefully stepped back up (almost slipping again) and returned to bike where i took out wet wipe(s) and uh like tried to wipe off my muddy ass and bleeding elbow and stuff. i covered elbow wound with wet wipe and unwrapped my towel gauze thing from my leg and wrapped elbow with it. i covered bike seat with plastic bag so i wouldnt get mud on the seat and rode on.

eventually reach the bridge that connect miyakojima with kurimajima (named appropriately kurima bridge). i rode across that, pretty cool because you can uh like see the water and stuff.

![6.27 17:13 Bridge](DSCF6397.JPG)

im riding to my accomodation but took a wrong turn and instead ended up at a little harbor where i took a few pics. The accomodation was in like the only little town area of the island so i rode into that and shortly arrived at what looked like the accomodation.

![6.27 17:27 harbor/pier thing](DSCF6421.JPG)

I wondered where to park my bicycle. in the parking lot that i wasnt sure belonged to accomodation? at side of house where it seem like motor scooter is already parked? just leave in road? hmm..

i sort of nervously pace around between side of house and parking lot and near entrance of house wondering where i should park bike, if im at right place, anxiety at hearing human voices, etc.

at some point someone comes out and i think says sth i dont understand. and then also says sth like "are you new person?" in english, and i affirm this. they walk over and consult about my bicycle parking. move the motorbike over a little so i have room to park bicycle, tell me park there.

They notice my elbow wrapped in my cotton bath-towel gauze thing which probably has blood stains on it and ask me what happened. i try to approximately explain it but idk what mud is in japanese and i doubt its a common enough english word so i think i just try to say like "slip" or sth.

::: aside
# communication
when communication with the guest house owner person (i think) (the person that is helping me with bike rn), the communication i think is some mix of japanese and english. i am established as america person now, or shortly after when they asked something like where you from, and i say america. and they said sth like oh so you speak america!

i think i tried to speak speak some abbreviated japanese as well as they i think tried to speak mostly abbreviated english. but sometimes i think they lapsed into japanese, or like japanese followed up by a simplified english summary. or something like that. and when i felt my japanese would have low chance of being understood i also used abbreviated english (which was probably a lot).
:::

they walk me into the guest-house. we pass the front yard thing where i think we passed a guest or someone or idk. i think the owner guy report to them that a new guest has joined. and i remember this part clearly: that they reported "they got hurt!.. :(" (in japanese). we enter through the front door which has been left slid open, slip the footwear off at the front shoe area which has many shoes, step onto the wooden floor of the house. the guy fetches a clipboard with looks like a list of reservations or sth with a single person on it. "this you?" (or sth) he asks. "yes" (or sth) i reply. "ok you got the twin room" (or so.) they say, and gesture to the room which has two beds. cool.

They walk me over to showers and show me them, say sth like: gotta shower clean that elbow bro!. i said: oh ok!, but, i can do later. then idk how the communication actually went, but we communicated the following to each other

- im going to the beach to see sunset
- wyd for dinner
- oh i bought sth from convenience
- oh like bento or sth?
- uh yeah
- oh ok well we are going to have bbq party tonight if ur down
- oh when is it
- 7pm
- oh ok
- u might not make it (sunset around like 7:30 i think) ok if u dont make it or ok if u make it etc

so i take my stuff get bike and bike off to the beach.

i reach the westward-facing beach. there is barely nobody there. some ppl far away maybe. it is near sunset time but not actually sunset time so the sun just shines into my face.

![6.27 17:58 Beach](DSCF6446.JPG)

I unwrap elbow and wash the mud and blood into the ocean. i wonder if i should take a little swim. I reason sth like, i will likely never be back to this beach again in my life. in a life with no regret and do what i want, i will take a little swim here. so, i took off the upper clothing and took a little swim.

it was a peaceful time in the ocean. not a worry in the world. the sun shining horizontally across the water. after an undetermined time of enjoying floating around, i emerge from the water to eat my food i brought from convenience store.

i unpack my foods onto the big rock i have placed my belongings on. the nonalcohol because im driving a bike beer slips from my hand and hits the rock and lands in the sand. the sand sticks to the sweaty beer and a pinhole hole now spurts the beer from the can. oops!

i cover the hole with my finger and rinse the beer of its sand in the ocean, open it, and drink it. while eating my other foods, a taco roll and famichiki. and water.

![6.27 18:16 Taco roll. This was yummy.](20250627_181609.jpg)

i also have the snack pine i bought earlier in the day, but i dont eat it, instead think to contribute to the bbq party reportedly happening at 7pm.

It is around 6:30 so i slowly make way back to the guest house. there was some empty concrete lot that i took some pictures in.

![6.27 18:23 Last look at beach](DSCF6455.JPG)

![6.27 18:38 Random empty lot on side of road](DSCF6461.JPG)

Arrive back at the guest house. my feet ngl were kind of still moist and sandy and i try to rub the sandy off etc before enter the house, greeted with a "welcome back"(s) (in japanese). the owner guy was at the kitchen counter looks like preparing for bbq party. i tried to say "i bought this snack pine" but idrk if i was heard so much as seen holding the snack pine. they said e.g. oh for the bbq party? and i agreed and put it on a counter and then put stuff in room and went to shower.

# the korean sign saying to shake off sand before entering house
at some time at my time at the guest house i noticed a sign at the entrance saying to shake off sand before entering house. for some reason i think this sign was only in korean. maybe it was also in japanese. but i dont think it was english.
:::

i showered and dried with the towel provided to me on my bed and changed into my newly bought and unwashed shorts. returning to my room, i heard someone something like taking a call or meeting in chinese. i sat in my room for a while wondering what exactly to do. it became past 7pm i.e. scheduled bbq event time and i sort of wondered if someone would invite me or i have to go over and invite myself.

::: aside
# I think new unwashed shorts irritated my skin
My legs got irritation the next day(s) where it touched the unwashed shorts i was wearing. so i guess the unwashed shorts caused that irritation.
:::

At 7:14pm in my notes application i recorded:

> i have social anxiety
>
> i want to ask for band aid..

at some point i decided to go ask for band aid. maybe that would get me an invitation to the party. i exited my room and slipped on sandals and peeked out into the front yard where some people were assembled around a table. i saw the owner guy and walked over and asked something about band-aid. i showed the wound when i was asked to display it and the reactions were sth like yowzers! ouchies!, type reaction. owner guy said sth like "damn looks like a cut" (i think) (in japanese) i think and walked me inside to get band-aid.

::: aside
# was the wound a scrape or a cut?
i still do not really know. when i looked at it in the mirror once it looked kinda like a deep-ish cut. idk how i got that from landing on a seemingly flat muddy concrete surface though. maybe i fell on a piece of gravel or sth idrk.
:::

they went over to a shelf and pulled out a box of stuff. the dialogue was approx. "hmm.. do i got band-aids.. hmm i think i have small ones.. oh i got them!". and also i think maybe some caring words of worry, e.g. "gotta be careful bro!" etc. They gave me a little squeeze of im guessing antibacterial or so cream from a small tube. and gave me a band-aid to keep for later and then pulled out another band-aid and unwrapped it and applied it on my elbow for me. very chill of them thanks!

and then they returned to outside and i returned i think to my room. i wondered if wrapping my stained bath towel gauze thing around elbow again would look too dramatic. but the band-aid was not very sticky and also i felt i could use the compression so i just wrapped it.

i was in my room and again wondered about the bbq event. so i went outside my room wander around again. i had done seen a clipboard on a table with like a sign-up sheet for the bbq event. i wondered if i should had put my name on it earlier or sth.

i didnt really know nothing. i wandered outside again and peek out into the front yard. someone at the table see me and said something like "looks like he wants to join" (in japanese). wow thank you yes i did want to join. various people gesture me over and decide where to seat me. i am sat next to another person at the one of the short sides of the rectangle table. i am brought uh like the paper plate and disposable chopsticks etc., and so i am joined into the party.

all members seemed to be the middle+ aged japanese mans. from the conversations i hear unfold, it seems that all except the owner guy was the guests, except maybe the guy to my left who seemed to be either a long-term guest or helper or idrked. their vibe was sort of like a helper. they also seemed to make an effort to trying to converse a bit with me in abbreviated english.

At some point what seem like lemon juice from plastic bottle was poured into everyone's paper bowl for dipping, and the first slices of meat was served. the meat was grilling on two little (charcoal?) grills placed on the table. the owner and a few of the table members managed the grilling i believe.

I ate my single piece of meat. tbh the plain meat was not very tasty. but the tofu salad that was distributed later at some point was (yum). i continued to sit at the table observing the members engaging in a conversation. some times, the guy on my left asked me a question or two. and i often attempted to return a question or two. the guy to my right at some point also asked me a question or two. once was sth like "so where u went in japan" and then i gave my kind-of-strange journey of miyazaki -> kagoshima -> fukuoka -> busan -> fukoka -> okinawa and then to everyone he was like ayo this is dude crazy u should let him talk more or sth (in japanese). someone asked "why busan tho" and i said i knew someone there.

at some time it was mentioned sth like do u drink/want to drink alcohol. i said sth like yeah im down bro and then went into house to find the alcohol. someone else, i think person that i describe in next paragraph take an alcohol from fridge and writes something on clipboard on top of fridge. It seems to be to keep track of what you ate so that you will pay the money later. The prices of various drinks are printed on labels stuck to the small transparent-door refrigerator. i analyze the fridge contents and pick something. i am confused by what the drink exactly is when the helper-like guy comes inside checking on me and explains to me in english take from fridge and write the name on the clipboard form thing. i said what i put down for this thing? he said beer. i said, just beer? he said yeah i think they'll know.

::: aside
# yeah it was just beer
i discovered later that the can i picked was literally just orion the draft but turned the other way so i was looking at the backside of it which had some other words besides the "orion the draft" logo which confused me.
:::

at some point another person joined the party, identified as i believe female from taiwan, i think slightly above my age. Based on initial conversation, it seemed the person speaking chinese earlier was them in a job interview?. Some people said something like: oh u two can speak english together bc both know english. and so they said e.g. hi where are you from and i said e.g. hi america and they said oh im from taiwan and i said oh my dad is from taiwan and they was like oh cool and then they/other people asked me e.g. "can u speak chinese" and i said um not really. oh ok

i continued to sit at the table sip on my beer and occasionally consume the morsels of food distributed to the people. honestly i dont really remember what was talked about. i think i remember some talk about irrigation and growing rice. i think this somehow evolved into talking about diff varieties of rice. and what would be difference between american and japanese rice?. i think that is when some people asked u good to drinking alcohol without rice? i said im good. but then it was decided yo get him some japanese rice, so the helper guy to my left got up to get me a bowl of rice.

i think this is when i got up as well to get another drink. this time not a beer but uh i think a low abv sweet beverage (horoyoi).

and so i received a bowl of rice and drinking my horoyoi (or maybe it was chuhai. dont remember). Continue to sit at the table listen to my fellow humans talking to each other. Some time idk when another two humans joined the party, two it seems japanese woman, it seem like they might have been mother daughter or young friend old friend relationship.

some time, i learned the guy on my left (helper guy) was from saitama. and they liked mountains more than sea it seem. and their best place in japan they think was i think mountains in nagano. they showed me a picture of mountains on they phone. i also got to demonstrate my incredible cutural knowledge by correctly saying that nasu means eggplant in english, and shiitake means shiitake mushroom in english.

There was also some bug at the function. there was one bug on the table, someone grasped it with they fingers and threw it into the bushes. I learned from this and some time later there was another bug on the table so i grasped it with my fingers and threw it into the bushes as well. There was also a bug on the guy to my left shirt so i pointed it and he was slightly confused and i said "bug" and "mushi (bug)" and they was like trying to get it off but i think it already went away. And also there was a bug on the taiwan girl shirt so i made eye contact and pointed at same spot on my own body and so they looked down at the spot on their own shirt and found the bug. There was also a big chonky spider hanging out in its web directly above my head. i think it was one of those big spiders with yellow striped legs that i have frequently encountered in japan and looked up once it sayed they are not venemous so i was not too concerned. i just occasionally looked up see if he is still there, and yes he was.

at some last point, someone pulled up to the guest house in they bike, eventually came over to the assembly. it seemed to be german male, perhaps slightly older than me. he pulled out a bento and many people was like "bentou!!???!? alright bro". the guy who was grilling stuff said u want me to warm up that fish (from the bento) and german guy said ok and so the bento fish was placed on the grill to be warmed.

some time i got a third drink, and some time the last item was grilled, i think it was chicken neck. tofu salad leftovers was also distributed which i yummily ate. chicken neck was quite yummy as i remember. it was the final pieces of food on the grill i believe and i guess i gave off the "silently eat a bunch of food" vibes so it was agreed "give it to him bro" so i was taking last pieces of chicken neck, but one of japanese woman agreed/indicated could eat some more so it was distributed to them as well. i put a piece back on the grill to be more evenly distributed.

the table was cleared. the helper guy asked me something like was the rice good? as took the rice bowl. i said [oishkatta(desu) :)](hell yeah bro). Some time after, a plates with fruits was broughten out. Pineapple, and watermelon. it was announced that i brought the pineapple, and i believe the guy on right side of table (from my point of view) who said they are a graphic designer brought the watermelon. Nice

Enjoy the fruits. i remember that the owner guy before eating his pineapple made eye contact with me across the table and held up show the pine hes eating and say [itadarkimas](thx bro). i dont really remember what kind of conversation was at this point. Not sure if at this time, but i do remember something like taiwan girl was informing japanese woman travel places in taiwan. German guy was informing japanese guy(s) they life status were on some vacation before becoming a teacher and had a communication error saying what kind of teacher they are going to become.

It was eventually dispersal time. i return to room. i wonder if there is going to be a star-looking party because i think i saw on google reviews someone said that the owner does that. and also i think i heard some talk during dispersion of going out to see the stars. i go to find use the bathroom but idk where it is so i ask in english the german guy who is at the public sink area thing and he tells me where it is and i go there. i think i went too past it or sth and he said sth like "uh you missed it/its on the right/etc"., and i found it and used it.

i think it was around now some people sitting the living/main area, i walked over to the host guy and said uh my glasses are broke do u have tape. i think he said something either like what bro speak english or bro do u think i am endless supply of random stuff, i dont actually know what he said but for some reason thats what it felt like said. some other guy said "yellow tape" and some other words to indicate it was on the counter. so i walked over and there was some yellow masking-like tape and i took some and replaced the tape on my glasses. This tape was much more effective it seemed.

After or before this, i then pace in and out of room not doing much in particular. It didnt really seem like anybody was going anywhere so i took my camera and leave the house, think about go back to beach to look at the stars myself.

But then one of i think fellow guests(?) came out of house and informed me, i think in mostly english(?), that later they are going to go see the stars. oh! ok. so i go back into house wait for that.

The middle age japanese dudes was assembled in the main room which was being fanned by the rotating electric fan. i felt sort of awkward so i didnt go over there, i went to room. but my room was sort of very hot and stuffy so i just go into main room. i think as i approach, a guy(s) gesture for me come sit. I sit there, on the floor which was floored with tatami. slightly to the left of a sliding door threshold i think.

I sit and listen. maybe i was asked a little questions. at least maybe by the guy who sat on my left before (helper guy) when he also came and sat down. someone remarked that we kinda had same vibes.

Taiwan girl also came over and apply bandage i think, and sit. someone said approx. dang all yall got hurt, he got hurt too. someone said how i got hurt? someone said e.g. while ride bike right?, i said no while walking lol. someone(s) said ?? walking??.

some time, looks like a new person come and check in. looks to be a japanese young man, idrk but probably equal or above my own age i estimate. they also come sat on floor with everyone chatting.

Some time eventually was time to go see stars?. except not really? waiting for some ppl? not rlly sure. some people assembled in front of house. i go as well bring my camera. some half of the group goes ahead. some part including me stays behind. besides me there is the guy who sat on left of me (helper guy) and one of the japanese woman. I think this was where and when the helper guy points out a splotch in the sky and says sth like "see that? thats the milky way". Interesting. i had never sawn the milky way with my eye i think. just stars. it looked like a spotch of light pollution. but in the sky.

The helper man and japanese woman chat as i fiddle with my camera. i think put my camera screen-down on the ground but even though i have screen protector that seems wrong so i run back real quick to house get my mini towel, put my camera on that. fiddle with the long exposure things a bunch for a long time and taking pictures while the the two are chatting.

eventually i think owner guy and maybe some other ppl comes back ready to guide us. as they walk towards us i think the japanese woman said sth in japanese and i wondered what a word meant so i asked sth like "[japanese word] means [english word]?", and i think she either didnt understand or didnt hear and either didnt say anything or said sth unrelated or that indicated that she didnt understand what i just said

so we walked into the darkness with owner guy, run into the ppl that went ahead. we join back together and led by owner guy. He leads us to a little observation area thingy where u can see the kurima bridge, and the sky. The owner person had brought a camera and they was taking pics of bridge. i did so also. we had a brief exchange saying what camera each had. after some time, owner man say u guys up for more walking? and the vibe was let's go so we let's went. We let's went to the mini harbor thing i actually went to earlier on accident. We walked up onto the pier(?) thing. There was some people fishing and lying down.

![6.27 22:58 Picture of bridge and sky](DSCF6532.JPG)

we walked out onto the pier and owner person sayed sth like stay behind me if ur not taking pics and then sat down and started taking pics i think. so i sat down and also start take pictures. im trying take pictures of stars but first time doing so, so i have to look up how to focus on stars (i thought u just need to focus at infinity or sth but that wasnt working). and frequently mess up my timer settings or bump my focus ring mess up my picture that takes 30 secs to expose.

owner guy say anyone want to pose for camera and they take some pics of ppl with night sky i think. i still sit on ground trying taking sky pictures, end up getting like one OK picture before it is time to return to house. We walk back in the same fashion as we came, someone holding a flashlight. spreading to the sides of the road when the cars come.

At the house it is now around midnight. i brush teeth and etc. reach the bed. Quite hot and sweaty. the window is open. I realize that there is a fan in the room. But the aircon i believe they say not gonna turn on unless you pay money in order to save energy. Then is the aircon coin operated or sth? im not rlly sure. i heard the german guy talking abt it during dinner. but i dont rlly see coin slot or whatever in my room. and i am good with just a fan. if there was no fan i would likely not be okay, but with the fan i was okay.

i point the fan at the bed. a hot summer night in the wooden japanese room. i go to sleep.
