# day 6: Fun in Okinawa

I woke up dont really know what to do or where to do. So i assume that when i woke up i thought about that. what to do or where to go.

I have some ideas in mind of where to go in Okinawa. For example, i want to go to "Miyakojima" which is a different island than I am on right now. Right now i am on big island. Maybe i should do something on big island before go to miyakojima. Not sure.

So i think about where to go on big island. Don't really remember how i thought about it. But I remember approximately two things in the thought process:

1. I dont want to go near america military bases because i heard they fucked up the environment around it or sth got chemical contaminations or whatever near it

2. i scrolled to the east on google maps and there looked like a nice geography so i thought: i should go there.

so i decided to go to the cool looking geography called "cape chinen" i saw on google maps. it was about an hour away by bus. I jogged/walked over to the bus because it was coming soon and google maps said the next one would come in 4 hours so i did not want to miss it (idk if there was alternative route but.)

i reached the bus area and i was running around looking for platform 7 and couldnt really find it but i saw the bus pulling up so i just followed it to its platform (7), got on it.

I ride that bus across the island. according to my emails, that is also when i booked

- flight from big island to miyakojima
- flight from big island to osaka
- hotel for the today night (on big island)

It is time to get off the bus. I was at the very back of bus so i get off last. Ahead of me, there was quite a few (i assume) tourists that was confused by maybe paying for the bus or some thing else i am not really sure. There was some communication error with one party and the bus driver and then one guy who was waiting did some interpretation between japanese and chinese and idrk what happened but eventually it was my turn to get off so i paid and got off.

It was a tourist center area. I entered the souvenier shop thing and looked around. I decided to purchase a suncream spray so i go to buy it. For some reason my credit card did not touch work, so i paid with cash instead.

![6.25 10:21 Looking around outside, i can see this building far away](DSCF5493.JPG)

Out side, i applied some of the suncream spray. Then i walked to a very nearby restaurant i saw on google maps. I was there and the seemingly automatic doors or sth didnt work. but there was a sign in japanese i think relating to the doors, but i didnt know some words so i turned away using my phone to look them up when some guy opened the door(s) say you here for [shokuji](食事)? somehow i pieced together/guessed that shokuji would relate to eating at the restaurant. So agreed i was was here for shokuji and he said something that the doors u have to manually open. oh i see.. and they guided me in and likely said something like "sit where u like".

::: aside
# the doors
they was heavy sliding glass doors. there was no handles or nothing evident. so you have to like wedge your hands in between them pry the door opens. Or use friction to slide it open with ur hands. idk what was up with those doors.
:::

He served me the typical glass of drink which i think was barley tea. i ordered slightly awkward, something like when specifying i wanted the large rice i might have been pointing sth that was specify noodle? type mixup. also i wanted the egg yolk which i could understand through the menu writing and picture but i didnt know how to say it so i just pointed to the menu and said and "this pls" and they just said [egg](卵)?. yes please

i sat there wait for the food after order. there was a party of korean people i could hear in my back, which sort of comforted me as a fellow foreign tourist.

The food came and i ate it. it was a bunch of raw fish in a rice bowl. i dont know if it was good or not it tasted like an average raw fishes. convenience store sushi i have had probably tasted better in my mind tbh. however i am not a connoisseur of raw fish.

![6.25 10:41 Food](20250625_104130.jpg)

I go to pay. i think on the slip of paper they give you keep track of what you order, the "large-serving" aspect of the order was recorded with a price. But when checking out the person turned to the back and called asked someone something like, "large-serving was free was it"? And i believe that it was thus removed from the price. Lucky! I pay, and exit through the heavy glass doors.

I walk across the street back to the tourist center area. There is a thing selling "Sata Andagi" which i learned from anime so i bought and ate one to try it. I also probably bought a drink from the vending machines.

![6.25 11:03 Sata andagee](20250625_110341.jpg)

Next i went to the tourism association center. except i wasnt really sure where it was so i walked through the building, exited out the back, took some pictures, circled around, entered building again. When I re-entered, i saw a counter at the front that i recognised as the tourism association so i walked up. There was a person walking into the office counter thing, so i engaged them and said sth like [RENTACYCLE](レンタサイクル). i didnt really need to complete the sentence because the person based on this initial phrase said sth like oh yeah person over there will help you.

The person over there came over here and helped me with rental process. Their english pronunciation was suspiciously american or something so i said [英語の発音、すごくお上手です](ur english pronunciation is fire) as a compliment. i think they said they had lived abroad which explained it.

They asked (in english) if i want helmet and i said do i need one? and they said no, so i didnt get one. they also asked where im going. i said sth like along the coast?. they sayed: want a map? i sayed: ok yes pls. They give me map. Further ask, are you going to mibaru beach? I reply, uh no. should i not go?. they reply, oh no you should go, show me it on the map. And then they also show me on map a bridge recommend to ride across. ok cool thanks!

Finally they take me outside prepare the bike. They explain stuff about bike like how to lock it and the buttons on the thing and the gear. they did this in their american-ish accent english but with the japanese speech pattern where you say [うん](yeah) after every other phrase said, which was a cool combination.

They send me off and i pedal off towards the direction i think they said was the cool bridge. It was uphill but the bike has electric assist so it was actually quite easy and nice to ride. I cross the bridge(s), it is a cool view. I continue on the path towards Mibaru Beach.

As i am cycling through to road, pass through town(s), a Costco comes into view. A costco wow!. I know costco i love costco cool. So i pull up to the costco just to take a look at it. I do not own a membership/only go in with parents so i cannot go in.

But then i see some people eating at what seems like the outside-of-store food court seating area, and they look like american people. So i park my bike and walk up to them and say in english, do you speak english. and they said yes. and i said i have membership in "the states" but not with me here can i walk in with someone :). one person said oh yeah but do u have it with u now ur america one works here also i say oh i use parents i dont got it. so one of the people rises from they seat and walks me into the costco. they ask if need to buy anything, i say no just look around (thanks). we exchange what usa states we are from, and they fist bump me and we part ways. thanks that person and people!

I walk around the japanese costco. Walk and look. Walk into the refrigerated area too. They had bread area too i think. just like america costco. they also had free samples. I got a bread sample. Overall, it was quite similar to the usa costco. except sell japanese stuff and also there is longer, more lines for the food court. and the food court sitting area seemed to be outside.

![6.25 12:24 Japanese Costco](20250625_122433.jpg)

Walked around and exit, i saw the same group of people still there. I walked over and pulled out some korean money and said "you guys ever been to korea?" intending to give the non-japanese, non-usa money as a form of thanks. but i think they may have not heard the korea part and just saw i was pulling out some money and they immediately said no ur good etc., i said alright thx and walked away, unlocked bike, rode away.

I continued on my way to Mibaru beach. Ride through the streets, on the side walk, etc. It was sunny.

Eventually i reached something that seems to be Mibaru beach. i parked bike and walk onto it. It was.. kind of very shallow, almost felt muddy. I touched the water with my feet, and it felt warm. I never knew beach waters could be that warm. There was a single party of two people other than me. And also a construction vehicle doing stuff sort of noisily.

![6.25 13:07 Picture](DSCF5601.JPG)

![6.25 13:09 In the shallow waters](DSCF5604.JPG)

It was not an especially nice environment so i left shortly and headed back northwards toward cape chinen, biking closer to the shore than when I come south. I stop shortly at a different beach which was equally as.. muddy? dry? shallow? idrk. I continue bike north, stopping some time to rest in some shade and book tomorrow's accomodation on phone. The path i take is sort of through quiet streets, through some streets look like next to some agricultural greenhouses, some peoples houses, and what not. I remember i got a drink from a vending machine that was in front of what seemed to be someone's house. I may have also stopped by another muddy/shallow beach.

![6.25 13:25 Some interesting rock steps i saw when stopping at a different beach](DSCF5637.JPG)

![6.25 13:59 I think this was another beach i passed by but did not spend much time at. it was quite hot and the only beach i was really interested in stopping by is one with lots of non-stationary water](DSCF5653.JPG)

I arrive back in the cape chinen area. i go to the actual cape and take some photos and look around. and then arrive back at the tourist information center. However, it is still some time before i absolutely must return the bicycle. So i decide to go slightly north to a beach i see on google maps.

![6.25 15:03 View from The Cape](DSCF5757.JPG)

I arrive at the beach. there seems to be like a side gate entrance or sth? idrk. i ride through that. Theres some pavement on top of the manmade barriers surrounding the "beach" so i ride to the end and park bike and look around and stuff. I then ride more towards the beach area when i hear some announcement being announced. It was in japanese so idrked what it said, but from what i understood it was something like "please only enter from parking lot and park ur stuff in the parking lot etc., person who just came in im talking about you". I think thats approx what they said and im guessing it was directed at me bc i was riding bike around. Oops! how embarassing. so i went back out the way i came and then looked for the parking lot, which i found. i didnt know if i had to pay or sth bc there looked like there was a toll gate. but the guy who was in there just gestured me go through when i made eye contact so i went through.

![6.25 15:22 View of ocean](DSCF5782.JPG)

thus i entered through the proper way. there was a changing/shower room where i took off my under-pants in case i wanted to swim in the beach.

The beach seemed to have two sections, one for swim and one for dont swim. I waded into the swim one. but it was kind of uninspiring. It felt very artificial. Also it was cloudy i think. So i left. bought drink at vending machine, put my underpants back under, return to bike.

I saw a sign in the beach saying something about parking fees, bicycle was how many yen. so when exiting on bike i was prepared to pay a fee. but the toll gate guy didnt seem to appear active. so i peered in the door and tried to say sth like "[駐車料金は](parking fee)". and he said sth like, bicycle? ur good. ok. maybe the sign in the beach actually said [バイク](bike) or so which i think means specifically (motor) bike. or maybe they just didnt care.

::: aside
# yes, i think it was just [bike](バイク).
looking up the beach's parking fees online, i think it was indeed just [バイク](bike) to mean (motor)bike which probably confused me.
:::

I ride back to the visitor center where i pull up in the bike. Someone outside see me and went to go get the same person that gave me the bike who said approx welcome back! how was it?, i thumbs up i think, sayed it was good!. and then they ask where im going next. i dont really remember what i replied because i dont think i even knew. But they informed me there is a bus soon, we have the bus schedule inside, etc. thank you very helpful!. i said thanks ill figure it out and i leave. i go to wait for a bus. realize im at wrong bus stop so i walk across street wait at the other bus stop.

Yes the bus was quite soon. it was good timing. The bus was sort of late (a few min). when it arrive, it honk honk at me, maybe to get my attention (or maybe it just wanted to honk. idk). When i got on the bus i think was looking for the number ticket you take when boarding bus but then there was a sign saying it is flat fee 300 yen that u pay when getting off bus.

I ride the bus to the hotel area. I walk to the hotel and check in. the person explains quite a lot of things to me in english while pointing and circling things on the piece of paper information they gave to me. e.g. that the hotel has bath, it has breakfast, and there is some lounge, etc.

I receive the room key, a physical key tied to plastic block display my room number. I go to room. The room is a neat looking japanese style room. This type of room made me want to sit in the little chairs on the floor and drink alcohol and eat snacks while staring empty minded at the television. So my plan became:

1. go to convenience store buy alcohol and snacks

2. come back to hotel area. there seems to be a restaurant on the hotel grounds and i will eat dinner there

3. After dinner, i will take a bath in the hotel onsen.

4. Finally, i will sit on the floor in front of the television eating snacks in a drunken state.

![6.25 16:58 Cool japan-style room. i think this was also most expensive place i have stayed at during trip.](20250625_165819.jpg)

But before i go to convenience store, I believe i this is when i went to the observation deck lounge thing the person that checked me in told me about. It is like some sort of cafe u can get a coffee and look out a large windows type of deal. Very cool. I went in and sat on a chair a little and took a picture or two and then left.

And i walk to convenience store. It is not very convenient to walk there. i must run across car road to get there and stuff. But it is OK i guess. I buy beverages and snacks and return to hotel.

Then, i realize that the restaurant at the hotel is actually closed at this time. oops!... Maybe i can buy hotel dinner buffet, or walk long or take bus to external food place, etc., but i dont really feel like it so i conclude snacks and alcohol should be enough dinner for me.

So i go to the onsen bath. the hotel instructions said something like tell them your room number and name to get a locker key and towel. I was slightly anxiety about having to do that. But then when i arrived they just said sth like "you here for bath right?" or something and i just agree and they give me key and tell me the towels are there, i take them.

I use the facilities. The view from the bath is cool. I finish. I see there is a vending machine with milk and brown milk. Cool i get a brown milk. it is a coffee milk. I have heard that eating milk after sauna/bath thing is appropriate to do. Not exactly sure why, but i did it, and it was nice.

I arrive back at the room where i then consume alcohol, and eat snacks, watch television, use phone in the drunken state. I also discovered i could open the balcony door even though i think there was a sticker saying please dont open the balcony door. But i went outside a bit anyways and took some pictures. I also set up the futon which i had never done before but there was instructions so it was easy (it was just tuck a sheet underneath a pad). I also brushed teeth and went to bed.
