# day 3: I Go To Huis Ten Bosch

Today i woke up in the kaikatsu club wondering where to go. I roughly wanted to go to west, to Nagasaki, etc., however dont exactly know.

Browsing google maps for the departing trains, i see a train for "huis ten bosch" coming soon, decide: maybe i should go to huis ten bosch.

::: aside
# huis ten bosch
huis ten bosch is a dutch theme amusement park. i saw it before on google maps and stuff.
:::

so i walk over back to saga station, buy a sandwich and barley tea real quick, and go board the train.

::: aside
# running
i think i was in a hurry and ran/lightly jogged to the train when appropriate bc it was too very close to departure time. i seemed to be very close to departure time a lot of times during this trip.
:::

im on the train eat my sandwich. then they say some announcement sounds like theres a cancellation of service going to huis ten bosch..

i record this announcement and re-listen it on my phone to try to understand it. yes it seems that there is a modification of service and the train only goes to "takeo onsen" and they say if ur going to e.g. huis ten bosch, please take shinkansen to shin oomura then transfer to another train take that.

so when train pulls up to takeo onsen i go and look for the shinkansen. when exiting the normal lines, i see there is a very long line at the station window, im guessing people getting their compensantory shinkansen/other tickets. but since i have jr pass i dont actually have to get that since its covered by pass; i dont have an actual ticket in the first place.

so i get on shinkansen, ride to shin oomura, got off. at this point i dont actually really know where im supposed to go so i just follow the crowd of people that look like they are in the same boat.

![6.22 9:54 Here is a picture i took before everyone else boarded train](DSCF4335.JPG)

and as a result i rode like one stop or sth to some train station and got off with some large amount of people. and then everyone kind of dissipated out go do idk what. idrk what was going on, even now. i believe i got off at oomura station and was confused what was happening. when everyone leaving, i look at the time table posted and see theres a train headed for sasebo/huis ten bosch (where i wanted to go) in a few tens of minutes, so i thought: maybe people is just here to spend time in the meanwhile. Not sure. i still am not sure.

i looked in the nearby convenience store, i dont think i bought anything. then i sit at the platform wait for the train to come. i saw some birds and a bug and took photo video of them.

Then the train come and i ride the train. it is a nice train. the train is called seaside liner and it does line the seaside. it is cool, i took some video of the sea going by, alongside another guy who was also taking video of the seaside going by.

![6.22 11:00 The floor had this very interesting pattern that looked like a bunch of QR codes. They did not scan on my phone though so I guess they were not actual QR codes?](20250622_110034.jpg)

However one thing that remains in my mind is that after pressing my camera lens against the window, when i removed it i noticed there were circular marks. i think my metal lens filter left scratch marks on the window.. oops....

reach huis ten bosch. walk to huis ten bosch. Walk over to the ticket purchasing area. I remember i was somewhat intimidated. but i just walked up to the window. and point at the 1-day pass thing i wanted which was on the paper posted on the counter and say the name. and they say ok and charged me money and gave me ticket. and i entered park.

![6.22 12:11 Park](DSCF4411.JPG)

walk around, look at things. neat. there were many Miffy (nijntje) attractions.

at some point i wanted to start use my japan data sim card because i wanted to look up park restaurants. The sim card actually has 30 day period so i could have started using it earlier. but what prevent me from use it is that it does not come with sim tool, that metal rod thing you can use to poke ur phone, eject sim tray. Last time in japan when i bought sim card it actually did not come with sim tool either. but i just used one of the staples from the instruction booklet, bent it straight and used that to eject the sim. But when i had opened this sim card package, there was no booklet that contained staples!!! oh no.

However i came up with an idea in the huis ten bosch, to rip open a mask and use the wire to poke the phone, eject the sim tray. I sat at a picnic table for a while trying to do this. And eventually it worked. Wow nice!

I used my data to look up the park's restaurants. Since it is Dutch theme park, i wanted to try Dutch food. However, it seems there was no dutch food. So i decided to go eat a chocolate curry i saw earlier.

Yes it was a park food establishment, you go in sit at a table and order via qr code online menu. I ordered Chocolate Curry and Chicken nugget & French fry.

The chocolate curry did taste vaguely like chocolate. The chicken nugget & french fry did taste like chicken nugget and french fry. However I think they might have given me 4 instead of 5 nuggets.

![6.22 13:06 The food I ate](20250622_130615.jpg)

Having eaten , i go to walk around and look more. there was a ferris wheel with no line, i ride it. cool. There was a mini shallow pool area, neat.

There was some "palace" which was a big house thing with a museum inside and garden behind. neat.

its a bit rainy now. im walking around. i happen to pass by something that looks like an art gallery or something. its named something like "greeting gallery". But what intrigues me is there is two people with camera with long lenses waiting in line for it, but also there is a framed pictures of e.g. A Triangle on the walls of the waiting room. I wondered what kind of art was inside this exhibit.

So i go to go in. A worker asks me something i dont really understand. i think one question was if i had the express pass or sth. i denied this. i was sort of spooked and ready to turned around, but the worker gestured me to go into the line, so i went.

I waited in the line not knowing what to expect. Eventually i am guided into a small room with some other parties of people. On the walls is some art. A picture it seems of a citrus. One of a landscape. An abstract piece. And a mobile with the sun, moon, and stars.

I photograph these pieces. It seems we are waiting to go into the next room. I do not know what is in the next room. More art? Idk because idk japanese so i mostly idk what the guide is saying.

![6.22 16:14 Art](DSCF4516.JPG)

We are guided into the next room. It is.. Person in miffy costume. Wow. I now understand why it is called Greeting Gallery. Each party poses with miffy, and the worker takes they photo with they phone. Wow. So i do it as well. Before each pose, the worker asks Miffy what pose shall we do. Miffy decides the pose, and we do the pose as the worker takes the photos. We hit two poses and i say good bye to Miffy. I leave.

Next I visit the "flower road" that i wanted to see. There are some flowers, some not bloomed yet. I see the flowers, and some windmills. I see a bird on a post in the river.

![6.22 16:31 Flower](DSCF4531.JPG)

Seen enough, i go to leave the park. But not in the same way i came in the park. I exit through the south parking lot so i may walk through what looks to be an interesting residential area i see on the map. However as i walk to it, i discover it is closed to general public, i cannot simply walk through it. So i just walk around it.

![6.22 17:02 While walking out of the parking lot, they seem to have have some part of the parking lot which is storing unused park items. here were some car things.](DSCF4571.JPG)

![6.22 17:10 Walking along](DSCF4577.JPG)

I reach my original point of entry of the park. I wonder to eat some noodles. But when i go to the noodle place, the vibe dont seem right, so i dont go in.

I walk to the station. My train out come in about 45 mins. I sit waiting, probably looking for hotel online, and regret i didnt eat noodles.

I ride to Hakata Station where i get off and visit the Yodobashi Camera. There, i enjoy to try out a cameras. Then, i buy a lens cap because i lost one of my lens cap today (idk where), and a lens wipe.

![6.22 20:08 Walking to the yodobashi](DSCF4604.JPG)

![6.22 20:10 This is the yodobashi](DSCF4609.JPG)

Then i train to the minami fukuoka station where i check into hotel. It is now time to eat. However as i look at the google map of places to eat, everything is closed except bars (izakaya). i dont like izakaya. its scary. I pick one restaurant nearby ish that seem to not be izakaya and i walk there. It appears to actually be an izakaya. i dont want to go in there. So i walk to a lawson buy microwave meal and stuff, eat it in hotel room.

![6.22 21:56 I walked through this empty i think shopping(?) street(?)](20250622_215617.jpg)

![6.22 22:30 depression meal](20250622_223005.jpg)

after night routine of wash and stuff, probably went to sleep.
