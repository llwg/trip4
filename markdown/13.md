# day 13: I travel across western Shikoku

i woke up to my early alarm which i set to try to catch a 6:47am bus. But, i felt not great so i likely set a later alarm and went back to sleep.

Then i think i got up around 8:30 or 8:45 or 9:00 or something like that, check out exit accommodation some time after 9 am.

The next corresponding bus scheduled after that 6:47am bus was scheduled for 12:51 noon. idk if there were some slightly alternative bus would have arrived earlier, but i suppose not because i didnt take them.

Until 12:51 noon i didnt have much idea what to do. i think to go get some food.

I look up food on google map. does not look like many option. i select one option entitled "tomato shokudo", walk into town to find it. I go to the place, and i cannot find it. now that i look on google maps street view, i do see a sign in front, but i dont think i saw the sign then. and im guessing the store probably didnt look very open even if it was there.

![7.2 9:29 Good morning](DSCF7624.JPG)

I gave up and then walked across the road and saw that something like the town hall is there. So i walked over into the town hall where i sat down on some seat in front of a pillar. Behind me behind the pillar seems to be some older folk watching the TV.

# the library

While proofreading i just remembered this extra bit.

Before i sat down or after i sat down or some time, I believe i also walked some stairs to the second floor which was reportedly a library. But when i arrived there there seemed to be a sign say its closed today. I was standing there looking at sign wondering if its actually closed or i just didnt know japanese and a woman also came up and looked at sign said sth like "Oh ðŸ¤”" aloud to nobody in particular so i left.

:::

I sat there in front of the pillar wondering, looking on phone(?) where to go. where to eat. sometimes i look around and observe my surroundings. looks about what you would expect a town hall to be. sort of like an office. to my left in the distant looked like some desks or something where you could go to enquire about town business and things.

i didnt really decide anything but then i got up and i think walked to the back and used the bathroom and then walked out of the building, i think because someone had taken the seat i was sitting at. or maybe because no particular reason. not sure.

i exited the city hall and it was hot. i wandered around wondering where else i can sit. i found some staircase leading downwards and i sat on the stairs, in a little patch of shade, look at my phone.

I had passed a food place earlier called "hotto motto", a bento place. i think i remembered i saw somewhere it was maybe a local chain store of somewhere in shikoku. which now that i search, is false. but anyways i hadnt ever eaten it so i think: maybe i should try it. It is opening at 11 am, and now it is slightly before 11am. So, i am on my phone trying to place online order. Place an online order requires a phone number.. and my american phone number fails their input field validation thing. so i try to make an account. i made an account, somehow successfully using american phone number. but order with account still seems to require re-entry of phone number or something??. or it fails?. i forget. So then i try just fake garbage phone number. And then something else fails. So i conclude, not possible order online, and i give up.

I felt quite hopeless and lost after that failure. i think i thought: maybe i just dont eat lunch. But then i walking over to that area, and i saw the store. and i approach it. and i sort of force myself. or mute my brain. and i walk into the store, a bit scared. There is a counter. a menu posted sort of vertically next to the counter. i already have approx what i want to get in my mind; I tried to order a large variety of things online, but i think i am uncapable and seems weird if i order that many things in-person.

So, i walk up to the counter. where someone came up attentively. i said an "et to" and i think hit a pose like scratching my head while considering the options of the menu. And i said something like "this red..beef.soondooboo..." pointing to the menu (facing only me) and reading off the menu name. The worker attending to me seemed to say the whole menu name to confirm with me, and i agreed. and i said large rice, and they probably confirmed large rice, and i agreed. and then i said And [chicken potato](chikipote) box and they probably confirmed by saying ok chikipote box and i agreed, said in yes in such a way that i hoped i confirmed that that was all i wanted, remained in a short silence and held my credit card a little closer to the register than i was ordering to hopefully indicate i was ready to pay. and so they processed my payment, gave me a receipt, i think probably say we will call ur number.

The store did not have much seating. it did have like one chair-looking thing i think. and one stool. i am guessing it was mainly designed for ordering externallying and picking up inside. and not waiting much inside. But i waited inside. sit on a stool. they had a little refrigerated selection of things to the left of the register counter with drinks, and sides. and stuff.

The person call my number and i stand up and go over and receive my food in the plastic bag, and i leave. Wow, i succeeded!

I want to eat along a river or some thing. So, i walk over to river. I reached a river area. But, i wanted a drink from a vending machine, and there was no vending machine directly near the river area. So i walked along the river area until i saw one, which was not too long, but a little long. i bought a diet coca cola and then walked a bit more, down into the river area which had a lot of tall grass and plants, but also some paths cleared through such vegetation.

Approach closer to the river, there was a bit of an access to the river, underneath a bridge. The access to the river was several large rocks, and so i climbed on to the rocks. but the river or the rocks smelled kind of funny so i think: maybe not great place to eat. So, i retreated to a lone bench, put down my things, and begin to eat my food.

![7.2 11:23 Feast](20250702_112334.jpg)

Its a soondooboo soup, rice, chicken, and french fries. eat it all in the disposable packaging they packaged it in. It was a peaceful day as i sat under the bridge, looking at the river area. but tbh it wasnt that beautiful. and i could smell the exhaust and hear the sounds of the truck parked, idling behind me. idk why it was idling but it was.

i took my time finish my food. i sort of wish i had a drink other than my diet coca cola. it was maybe first time in life i had eaten diet coca cola btw. I slowly finish my french fries, and compose this poem.

![7.2 11:44 Potato](20250702_114455.jpg)

I gather my trash in the plastic bag and leave my bench, begin walk back. There were many cars and trucks parked underneath that bridge. seem like people resting in them. maybe lunch break of some sort.

![7.2 12:01 Good bye, bench](DSCF7627.JPG)

I walk along that grassy vegetated river area. In the direct sun, it is quite hot. Walk back the way i came, back to the city hall. I used the city hall bathroom again, holding my bag of trash between my legs as i wash my hands in the sink.

![7.2 12:07 Through the vegetation](DSCF7629.JPG)

![7.2 12:14 Grass](DSCF7632.JPG)

I walk out into the front of city hall, where there is a bus stop. Google map say i can ride bus here. and the bus stop info does seem to indicate yes bus stop here at that time. So i wait a bit, and a bus comes. It is such a cute bus. a toyota bus. a retro vibe. round and cute. i wish i had taken a picture of it.

I was only one getting on bus i think. im getting on and there is no ticket pulling machine, so i am confused. i peer at the driver i think, and the driver says something about where they going. and says where are u going? and i think i say uhh and pull out phone either show or read out "ekawasaki" and i think they was like oh yeah ekawasaki ok. i say is there no [seiriken](ticket thing)? and they seem to say: yeah nope, so i just take a seat. and bus departs.

The seats and bus in general was sort of retro i think. the seats were covered in clear plastic covers. a few but not many people got on bus. i sat there wondering how tf they going to calculate my fare and stuff they just remember me?? what is happening?.

![7.2 13:45 Im on the bus](DSCF7638.JPG)

They make a brief stop at a midpoint, where elderly woman also got off. seems like driver had friendly chat or sth with the woman while taking the midpoint break.

Eventually, continue onwards. Another thing about this bus is there was no announcement or digital system thing that announces the stops unlike i think like literally every other bus ive taken in japan. i dont even remember there being a "request stop button" i think?.. so idk how people who getting off at a smaller stop going to signal get off. yes i had no clue but anyways i think my stop was maybe last stop so i just sat and looked out window and stuff.

::: aside
# there was someone that got off at middle stop i think, but idk how they did it.
I think there was someone behind me that got off at a non-major stop. but for some reason i dont remember how they signaled intent to stop or how they paid. i had no clue what was going on.
:::

Eventually the bus neared the spot which google map says is my stop. the bus did a off-course loopty loop type thing which slightly worried me what if i need to tell driver pls let me off. but then the bus pulled up right in front of the ekawasaki station where i need, fantastic. i walk up to the front and say "[unchin](fare) ha ...", and they specified an amount. the fare box as i recall was just like a plastic transparent box. i think. i dont think it was connected with anything??. i forget. its all a haze. but i pay my fare, fumbling to insert my 1000 yen bill into the box whose slot has strange slants. I get off the bus.

Ekawasaki station was one of those open air stations where there is no actual gates, no entry door, no exit door, just sort of like a roofed area with a little sitting waiting area where you can walk across the track to reach the single platform.

However there seems to be a little building attached to that roofed area, with some kind of service window. perhaps selling tickets?. After look around a bit at some kind of posted fare charts and schedules and stuff, i prepare the fare i would need to go to Uwajima in coins and walk up to the window.

The person seems to acknowledge my presence but seems to be taking a phone call. And then i hear a train arriving, so i leave that window, go out to the tracks look at the train that just arrive, a cute little yellow single-car train.

![7.2 14:18 So cute](DSCF7650.JPG)

I may have been looking at or taking pictures of the train when someone come out the office say i think "did u need something ?", and i say something like "oh, [kippu](ticket) ha", and then they say something like "Oh, tickets-- you uh-- where are you going?", and i said Uwajima, and they reply approx Oh uh Uwajima.. oh i think that train is uwajima?? and they i think essentially explain to me its one of those trains where u take the [numbered ticket](seiriken) when u get on and pay when get off etc. oh ok thank you! i said both nonverbally and verbally i think, and they return to they office i think.

And so i am in the train, taken my numbered ticket. there was some other people at the back of the train near entrance/exit. i go walk to middle sit down. but then i realized i should take some pics!, so i walk to back take some pics. normally i kind of feel weird so blatantly taking pics of public-ish spaces in the presence of others. but the people on the train kind of seem like fellow tourist vibes, and also i think i am gradually losing my inhibitions some places.

![7.2 14:20 Pic of train interior](DSCF7653.JPG)

And there was some time waiting before departure. so i exited the train go take some pictures outside. There were some other touristy looking people taking pictures, middle age men. i guess i am just a slightly younger middle age men.

![7.2 14:23 Pic outside](DSCF7662.JPG)

![7.2 14:29 Pic 2](DSCF7669.JPG)

![7.2 14:34 Station](DSCF7672.JPG)

![7.2 14:35 Dragonfly](DSCF7674.JPG)

![7.2 14:37](DSCF7677.JPG)

I was taking some pics and i think looking up at maybe a bird i saw perched on outside of station when the station lady person that i think was the person that explained tickets earlier to me sayed to me something like, "ah!, [kotti](over here).", and the said something about a "[hina](currently unknown)", and pointed out to me a bird nest built over a security cam or light or something. In the nest there seem to be a young Bird making an 0: face. i forget how i responded to person who had just pointed this out to me. But i took some pictures of this, and also what seemed to perhaps be the nearby parent.

![7.2 14:39 Bird](DSCF7681.JPG)

![7.2 14:42 Bird](DSCF7685.JPG)

i also bought a vending machine drink, and used bathroom, and took those pics before boarding the train. And i go back on the train, and the train departs. On the train i looked up what "hina" means maybe its some kind of bird. but it seems to mean "young bird". which made sense in context.

I sat on the train in the middle. One or maybe two or even three middle age mans sit in the back. One of them had a carrier with them i remember. One middle age man was at the front take some videos out the train front and windows. i take some pics and photos too. the train rolls through the west shikoku scenery. through trees. next to mountains and agricultural-i-think fields. very serene. great train ride.

![7.2 15:46 Wow](20250702_154606.jpg)

When got closer to destination, some students got on i think. Eventually reach the destination, Uwajima.

When exit the train i thought i would pay at front of train, but train person said sth like pay at the station pls. so i went to station. at the exit window, the person accepted my number ticket, i think tell me the total. i may have handed them the exact money because i probably calculated it already from the screen inside the train (i think).

Walk out the station and there is a seven eleven. Probably walk back into station and buy ticket to my next destination, and there is a bit of wait time, so i go into the seven eleven browse around. There is a souvenier corner i remember. And then in the alcohol corner i spotted a rare(?) alcohol that i had been wanting to try for quite a while in my life, so i picked it out even though i wasnt in particular planning on buying anything from the convenient store. And to go with it, i pick out a pizza bread and bottle of water.

::: aside
# the alcohol i wanted
last summer i think in japan i was watching the hotel tv, i think when i was depressed after eating a large katsu curry?. i saw some news segment or sth about "future lemon sour" by asahi, it is some alcohol canned product, the top of the can comes fully off, and they put a whole actual lemon slice in there. what?? lemon slice in a can?? thats crazy. so, I wanted it. but, it was the only limited releases. near tokyo or sth. i wasnt near tokyo. and when i was in tokyo later in the year i didnt find it either. but somehow i randomly found it this year.
:::

the guy checking me out asked me sth like [fukuro daizyoubu desuka](you good with no bag?), and tbh i wanted a bag. but the effort of trying to reject the question and asking um no actually can i get a bag in a language that i dont know was too much, so i just said e.g. [hai daizyoubu desu](yeah) and carried my stuff out in my hands, take my bag off and stuff it inside to carry it while i use bathroom before get on train.

![7.2 16:24 View from the front of station](DSCF7717.JPG)

My train comes and i get on my train, which is another anpanman themed train. i lay down my bread and crack open the alcohol on my little fold out tray and enjoy the ambiance. As the train departs, i sip on my lemon sour and eat my pizza pan on the anpanman limited express to Matsuyama.

![7.2 16:41 Awesome](20250702_164127.jpg)

![7.2 17:12 On the train](20250702_171255.jpg)

The train reaches matsuyama and i get off and walk eastward to go to hotel. I walk through a large flat grassy park-like area overlooked by castle on hill. I passed by some police officer confronted some people that was speaking sounded like english about seemingly cannot play soccer in the park or something (they was holding a soccer ball i think).

many people walk, bi cycle. i walk through the park, eastward.

![7.2 18:51 crows on the castle](DSCF7773.JPG)

![7.2 19:06 Shibuya?](DSCF7796.JPG)

![7.2 19:13 Dilapidated thing](20250702_191358.jpg)

I reach the hotel and check in. I reach the hotel room, which kind of smells like smoke. The floor itself also smelled like smoke. im guessing i accidentally booked something that did not explicitly say no smoke room and thus got a smoke room. To add this suspicion, i later saw sign above bed saying "please refrain from smoking in bed". so i guess smoking in rest of room was probably okay. though i dont remember seeing any ashtray or whatever.. idk maybe didnt look hard enough.

Smoke room was a disappointment. Also no room pajamas was a disappointment because i wanted to wear them while washing both pairs of my pants instead of having to wear one while washing the other one.

I was disappointment. i was probably out of energy with disappointment or something so for dinner i went down to nearby seven eleven and browse their foods after i put my laundry in the hotel coin laundry.

::: aside
# this hotel coin laundry
i liked this hotel coin laundry. it was like the setup at net cafes, the top-loading washer with a front-loading drier on top. 300 yen wash, 100 yen for 30 mins drying. i like that.
:::

There was some local beer at the convenience store so i got two different ones, spaghetti bento, a 1l bottle of water, pudding, and when checking out i requested a seven eleven fried chicken (nanachiki). the guy said sth like, "one, right?" and i said yeah. and i think they may have asked about bag and gave me a bag and then seemed to forget about the nanachiki. i finished check out, received the bags, make my way towards door but look in bags, do not see nanachiki. dont remember guy fetched the nanachiki. Maybe i just failed to communicate i wanted nanachiki at all? But i look on receipt and Nanachiki was listed at the very top.

I sort of think, maybe just dont care. maybe not worth ask for it. I dont need the nanachiki. But only the past me would be afraid to ask for my nanachiki. This is the new me. and so i went back to the register and showed the guy my receipt with my finger indicating towards the nanachiki on the receipt and i said Uh Nanachiki Ha, and then he said sth like omg sorry and got the nanachiki and said real sorry about that!, and so i received the nanachiki, and so i left.

I was warming up my pasta bento in the hotel lobby microwave when i noticed that actually the sleeping wear was in the lobby next to the other self-serve amenities. omg i could have washed my other pair of pants!!!. how sad.

i handle my laundry maybe, wash maybe, and et cetera before i begin to eat my meal, Or maybe while i am eating meal. i forget. But i do remember when going up and down from the laundry machine floor, i wanted to use stairs. but for some reason the stair doors lock from the inside i think. but you can just unlock them. from the inside. so over the many trips i went up and down from the laundry machine to handle laundry, and also fetch a plastic cup to pour beer into, i unlock the door to my floor and laundry floor and just walk up and down the stairs, which is exposed to the warm humid outdoors. and seem to also be used by cleaning staff from the looks of it.

The plastic cup they had at the ice machine in front of laundry machines was quite nice and sturdy and large. I use it to pour and drink beer. The local beer. The beer tasted like beers. While drink beer, i eat the pasta. yum. and chicken. yum. and finally the pudding. which is maybe first pudding ive eaten in life. yum. i enjoy my food and drink as i inhale the slightly smoke air of my smoke room.

# famous onsen
the beer i ate i think is from some place in matsuyama that is also famous for some old famous onsen i think. i didnt know they had famous onsen until i was looking up matsuyama after i ended trip. oh well. such is improvised travel.
:::

I had TV on i think, but also look at my phone. and disoriented by effects of alcohol. so i dont really remember what happen. except finishing up my pasta and chicken. sit on the bed. et cetera. I can only imagine that i brushed my teeth and went to sleep type deal happened.
