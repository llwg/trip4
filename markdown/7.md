# day 7: I go to Miyakojima

Today i woke up. i strolled down to the breakfast buffet in my room clothes and slippers. i wondered how they are going to check breakfast eligibility because they didnt give me a typical voucher or something at checkin. Observing whats happening at the entrance counter, i see you tell the person your room number. I tell them my room number, in japanese (wow!). They look through the list and find me and say: you are [name]?, and i say yeah and they say something i think in english about put this card thing on ur seat, gave me the card.

# maru in the room name
i have heard that in japanese it is often said maru instead of zero when reciting room numbers. idk why. i think Maru means circle thingy. and zero is a circle. my room number had a zero in it and i said it as Maru to the person and it was understood. wow, real life practical application!

i ate the breakfast buffet. one cool thing they had was okinawa soba u can assemble urself, warm up the noodles in a basket and etc. it had black colored noodles as well.

![6.26 7:56 Here was some food. i remember that bowl of multicolor rice was a bit awkward because while i was getting it from the rice cooker someone came over i think looking to get some and i was there scraping out the last of it. but, when i went back shortly later there was fresh pot.](20250626_075637.jpg)

After finished breakfast, return to room, probably did something like showered, pack belongings. Probably or maybe also used phone, plan day as well, but i dont really remember in that much detail.

Check out of hotel and walk over to bus stop. I take the bus back west to Naha where my goal was to eat lunch at a tacorice place. Contemplated what tacorice place to eat at, picked one chain i saw in some youtube video and looked to be convenient-ish on my way back to naha airport.

So I took bus, and a monorail, and walked, where i reached the tacorice place. The branding and vibes i got from their website and pictures was that maybe it was run by american people and the cashier would look very american and i could just speak english and be very american with my fellow american person. However when i entered it was sort of cramped and there was some ppl finishing ordering or idrk and it was a short little awkward period of mentally preparing myself to order and being cramped making sure im not smacking into any one or thing.

The person uh idk didnt really have any obviously american vibes so i just tried to order in japanese. idk why but the ordering felt more awkward than usual. i guess i had never very often ordered at a counter. I think i was ordering by staring at the menu posted high up on the wall behind the counter. I say something like "Tacos.. and uh.." to ordering tacos. To which i believe the person reply asked about how many i wanted?. Oh there is different sizes? the menu listed the options as 1P or 3P which was sort of confusing because idk how u read 3P and what exactly the P signifies. (piece?). I think i said 3[個](ko).

yeah i dont exactly remember how the ordering went but eventually it was over and its time to exchange money. but my credit card touch doesnt work and they was trying to figure sth out and i said cash is ok and paid in cash and it was done.

I sat myself to wait for the food. The shop seating area was quite small. the small table i sit at meant for max two people. on my left and right was the same type of table hosting two parties of two people who sounded multilanguage or cultural or something and also young.

The food arrive. it was yummy. the taco rice is a taco rice bowl. the tacos is tacos. The taco shells was very deep fried flour tortilla crispy crunchy yum taste. I ate yummily staring blankly into the space in front of me because there was not much other place to look if i turned my head i would be looking at an another party. I wished that i had ordered a drink also because it would have tasted yummy with the meal.

![6.26 12:34 Wow yum. Inside the red squeezy bottle i believe was some salsa-like substance.](20250626_123400.jpg)

![6.26 12:34 Some of top tier taco interpretations i have eaten in life. The highlight for me was the taco shell. I think, suppose it was a deep fried flour tortilla instead of corn tortilla. I have not had many flour-hard-shell-taco tacos that much in my life. not sure why. In the rare occasion i do get to eat hard tacos, its usually corn shell it seems.](20250626_123404.jpg)

![6.26 12:35 Taco rice, mixed](20250626_123534.jpg)

I finished the food and return the tray and leave. walk back towards where i came from, where i pause at a lawson. on my way over i had seen the advertisement flags outside advertising some kind of "[沖縄ぜんざい](okinawa zenzai)" which looked to be perhaps shaved ice but okinawa. Intriguing!. And so after my tacos, i think to challenge myself to go into the lawson and get one for myself.

I enter the lawson and go to the register as the flag said to do. There is a lady standing behind a register, and so i engage with her. I say: Okinawa Zenzai(ha arimasuka (i may have said this part as well)). The lady replies, oh yes, okinawa zenzai! (probably). and then she says something seemingly concerning mochi that i do not completely understand. She pulls out a sheet of products with the names and barcodes and pictures to show me. As i say a very long "uhhhhhmmm", I infer from context that she is asking sth like which variety do i want, and the varieties are on the sheet of products. I look at the sheet of products and point at one that looks good and say [kore de](this one) and they say sth i think like "ok the [mochi ari](with mochi) one".

Looking back, i think her initial question may have been simply "There is one with mochi and one without. which one do u want?". But on the sheet there was many varieties i think like milk one and diff toppings. If that were indeed the question, luckily i think i chose one of the two most appropriate choices. though if i chose a diff one i doubt there would have been a problem.

So she said ok thatll be 320 yen and i said (credit) card and i paid and she disappeared and i heard ice crunching machine noises and she returned with the constructed product and i said thx and left. i wonder if i also got a bag to carry it in. but the receipt doesnt list a bag fee on it so im not sure if i just wasnt charged for it (asked me after finished payment so just gave it to me) or i just didnt get a bag. I think i did though. i dont really know though. I guess i will never know. I did receive a plastic spoon though.

With my newly acquired okinawa zenzai i walked to a nearby park i saw on google maps. The park was like a giant sidewalk between two streets with some grass and trees planted. Not the most park park, but uh better than nothing i guess. I sat down on a concrete cube seat thing and enjoyed my okinawa zenzai. Which was essentially crushed ice with some flavor at the bottom and a few mochi. it was ok i guess.

I saw a pigeon, and a fellow human eating some food (independent of the pigeon). I took some pics of the pigeon and its friends. i also paused to look at a construction scene going on that an older fellow seemed to be watching. i took a video of them putting in a large metal thingy on the building and then left, go to naha airport.

# i bought okinawa ic card
okinawa has its own ic transportation card called Okica. many of the buses dont use other big japanese ic cards only the okinawa one, i think. At some monorail station i saw a sign at a ticket machine saying it sells Okica. so i bought one. mostly for a souvenier i think. but i did use it some. I think that monorail was the one i took to naha airport right now. Or maybe it was earlier today. honestly dont remember lol.
:::

Im at the airport. Check-in was at a self kiosk as was all of my domestic flights this trip. i took some photo video of planes at the outdoor observation deck, and then go to take flight. When boarding flight they offered an "okinawa fruits candy" and i took a mango one. i sat on the plane on the way to Miyakojima.

The plane soon arrived at Shimoshijima Airport. if you notice, Shimoshijima is different from "Miyakojima". thats bc its Shimoshijima is actually a different island connected to miyakojima by bridge and its like a 45min or 1 hr bus ride from the cityesque part of miyakojima. I didnt know that when booking tickets! but even if knew, probably same book. because was cheaper than fly to actual "miyako airport" (right next to city place).

Get off the plane it was neat because evidently the airport did not do any walkway thingies that connect directly into airport. it was just like large parking lot the plane parks u get off walk into the little airport building.

Walk through the small airport exit, look for the airport bus. The aiport bus apparently only run a few times a day for each of the arriving or departing flights. i.e. if u have a flight and dont catch exactly the bus corresponding to ur flight that will be an oopsies. Not too sure about other non-airport buses but looking at google maps did not seem very robost bus coverage, schedule.

Butt anyways i found the bus thing. There was a bus.  I also saw a place looking like it is selling tickets. For the bus?. I think so. There was a single person there. i dont want to walk up alone to this single person unprepared. so i walk past and pace around look at phone or idrk what im doing besides procrastinating walk up buy a ticket.

I think eventually someone else did walk up and buy a ticket which felt more reassuring because i might have heard some of the dialogue and thus learned approx what was going on. So eventually i walked up. the person was no longer standing there, they was sitting inside. so i peeked over the counter slightly and they notice me. ask me sth like where r u heading?. i am guessing i pointed the the stop on the paper and said "here" because dont think would have had the ability or confidence to say the actual name (公設市場前). They said something i didnt understand and i looked confused and they said sth again, which i understood as "thats 600 yen". so i placed the 600 yen i had already prepared because i looked up everything online beforehand in the money tray and received my ticket. i believe they further told me to ride the orange bus.

I rode that orange bus and i arrived at the 公設市場前. I walk to a place to have dinner. When i looked at google maps, most of restaurants in area, especially at this time (5:30) was Izakaya. i dont want izakaya because they are scary. so instead i decided on the family restaurant "Joyfull". I like family restaurants because usually open late-ish, serve nice variety of foods, not very expensive, easy atmosphere, etc.

This is second time i have been to "Joyfull" family restaurant. This might also the first time i have been a second time to the same brand of family restaurant. Neat.

The ordering is to be done on the tablet at the table. I stare and tap through the menu for a while. I decide on an Okinawa Soba and small hamburg steak and karaage meal.

They have a serving robot playing cheerful sounds running around. I believe it delivered the meal of looks like salary man who is sat across the aisle from me. However when my meal comes it is broughten by a human. They was accompanied by another human by they side who appeared to be in training.

I ate , and paid , and left.

# fragmented memories of sashikomi
i dont know if it was here. might have been. but i remember one time when i was paying, i think at a family restaurant. i was paying via credit card. the card reader says sth like touch or insert your credit card. so i tried to tap it. but it didnt work immediately, and i had theorized that my credit card tap has just stopped working in okinawa or forever. so i inserted it instead. But during this process i believe the cashier said sth like "touch ur card pls" or "its touch". but i think saw it didnt work (immediately) and saw me inserting it and it working and said like "oop [mb](my bee) its [insert](sashikomi)". and then idk if this was the same occurence, but i think they ask if i wanted my receipt and i said im good. i think it might have been this occurence because i cant find picture of my receipt in my photos. i tried to take pictures of all of my receipts to remember more.

dont know if i was just impatient with the touch or did not actually work with my card.

Having eaten my meal, I walk over to the accomodation for the night. Walking through the city/town, walking next to some plots of land. Land has some dirt. some plants. etc.

![6.26 18:38 Pigeon i saw walking over](DSCF6167.JPG)

![6.26 18:41 Clouds i saw walking over](DSCF6174.JPG)

![6.26 19:01 Stuff i saw walking over](DSCF6200.JPG)

I was slightly afraid to arrive at the accomodation. i booked it mainly because it was cheap. All the regular hotel in miyakojima seemed quite  expensive. So i booked this one which say its "guesthouse". it look okay, location okay, good price. Reviews on Agoda seem okay enough. But when i was reading reviews in detail, some was quite negative, bad air in room, etc., and i was sort of spooked. Dont really want to inhale mold for a night just to save some tens of dollars.. but, some reviews seemed OK or positive, so i decide follow through staying there.

Arrive, sort of looks like a house. idrk what a house looks like though. But i open the sliding door of the main building/house. there is a tablet where check-in is performed. It asked for the code that was sent to me. But pretty sure nobody sent me nothing so i used the alternative name search to find reservation. then it make you take pictures of ur passport and your self. and that was the check in.

My room was in the other building accessible by walking through some overgrown grass and a narrow outdoor hallway. room is unlocked with the key left in the room (as they intended). A very simple room with a bed in two of the corners, a small table in the third corner, and the aircon in the top of the fourth corner. A light is on the ceiling, and i think it dont even have a switch, controlled only by the remote left on the small table next to the aircon remote.

![6.26 19:30 Walking over through the grass into the narrow outdoor hallway](20250626_193050.jpg)

The room air was quite terrible. Musty, mildewy, etc., so i opened the window and turned on aircon to circulate some air. The beds had blue sheets and was springy.

I went and go take shower. It was in the main building, and i take my phone and charger to charge there a bit while im in the shower, because my room had no outlet lol. there was some extension cord in what looked like a commons room or so, so i just plugged in and charge there, leave while im shower.

One of shower seemed to not work.. so i used other one. Also, in the shower my glasses fell onto floor and the frame broke and lens fell out. Oopsies..

![6.26 20:07 Broken glasses](20250626_200733.jpg)

I brush my teeth getting ready for bed in the main building, someone else came in and checking in. Then they was wandering around looking at the rooms looking kinda lost. After nonverbally acknowledging their existence, they said sth like "U know where room E is?" (in japanese). and with toothpaste or etc in my mouth i said "[boku gaigokujin desukedo](I am not japanese)" and then scurried over to the check-in desk where there is a map of all rooms and i pointed at the room they asked about (its outside). and they probably said like ohh over there? oh i see. oh thanks. or something. and then we had a little chat where they said sth like where u from? and i said america. and i think they said "oh ur half?" and i said e.g. "im chinese american". and i think they said something about ohh. maybe something about chinese people and/or they thought i was from actual china or idrk. and something else like "oh so ur half" and i probably said e.g. "uh no im just uh.." and then i *think* they said sth like "oh but ur like half in the sense that ur nationality and ethnicity is different" or something like that. im not actually sure what they said but thats what i got out of it. and i said "ohh i guess so yeah haha" and they probably said thanks bye and we parted ways.

Finally i return to my room done with night routine. i rip off some of the label of my small notebook i have in bag and try to fix my glasses frame. The label is not very sticky so it does not work very well. Also, i book another accomodation for tomorrow. In fact, another guest house. but the reviews look more promising than the one im sitting in now breathing bad air. And so i go to bed, wearing a face mask over my mouth.
